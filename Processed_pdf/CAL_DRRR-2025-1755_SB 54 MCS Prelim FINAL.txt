Executive Summary and Background 
Lawmakers enacted the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer 
Responsibility Act (Senate Bill (SB) 54, Allen, Chapter 75, Statutes of 2022) (the Act), 
establishing an extended producer responsibility (EPR) program to reduce single-use 
packaging and plastic single-use food service ware (covered material) in California, 
while ensuring the covered material is recyclable or compostable and that covered 
material meets certain recycling rates. 

The Act requires the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery 
(CalRecycle) to conduct a material characterization study of covered material and 
determine the approximate amount disposed of in California landfills (see Public 
Resources Code Section 42061(a) (2-3)). Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory 
references in this report are to the Public Resources Code (PRC). 

CalRecycle contracted with Cascadia Consulting Group (Cascadia) to conduct a 
statewide material characterization study to characterize and measure the amount of 
covered materials landfilled in California. Fieldwork, which included hand-sorting 
samples at California landfills, occurred between February and April 2025. CalRecycle 
and Cascadia designed a study that incorporated representative, cost-effective 
sampling and analysis for data gathering that minimized disruption to facility operators. 

This preliminary findings report provides estimates of the amount of covered material 
landfilled in California, by weight (tons) and as a proportion of total material landfilled 
statewide. It also includes information from additional analyses of resin types of plastic 
covered materials made of plastic that could not be identified in the field, as well as 
estimates of the weight of covered material discarded together with food or other goods. 

It was estimated that 7,800,136 tons of covered material were disposed of in California 
in 2024, representing about 19.6% of total landfill disposal in California. 

For more detailed findings, refer to the Summary of Findings section. The findings 
presented are specific to SB 54 covered materials and thus do not provide granular 
information concerning other materials. Preliminary data on other materials are included 
in the appendix. 

Public Feedback and Next Steps 
Section 42061(a)(3)(A) directs CalRecycle to publish preliminary findings of the study 
and conduct a public meeting to present those findings and receive public comments. 
CalRecycle plans to conduct additional advanced statistical analyses on the data 
presented in these findings. Updated preliminary findings will be presented at an 
informational session and in a published revised preliminary report in Fall 2025. 
CalRecycle will accept written feedback at any time, plans to hold a public meeting to 
further solicit public comments, and will finalize the report within 60 days of the public 
meeting. 

All written feedback can be submitted to wastechar@calrecycle.ca.gov with the subject 
line: SB 54 MCS Preliminary Findings.

Data Records Available Pursuant to the 
California Public Records Act 
Public records related to this report can be requested through the CalRecycle Public 
Records Portal and include records documenting analysis steps, often as scripts in the 
R Statistical Program: 

•  Estimates of statewide disposal, all materials 
•  Estimates of statewide disposal, Covered Material 
•  Percentage composition of each material type within covered material classes 
•  Composition estimates for material types within sectors 

Methods 
Overview 
To estimate statewide disposal of covered material, two main steps were undertaken. 
First, sampling was conducted at 16 landfills across California to estimate the 
composition of landfilled materials by waste-generating sectors. Second, the 
composition was extrapolated to estimate statewide disposal using data from calendar 
year 2024 submitted to CalRecycle’s Recycling and Disposal Reporting System 
(RDRS). 

A random sampling methodology was used to sample waste from various sectors to 
develop a waste composition profile for each sector. The four sectors considered in this 
study included: (1) franchised single-family residential; (2) franchised commercial and 
multi-family residential; (3) self-hauled; and (4) mixed waste (i.e., material from transfer 
trailers). The data from each sector were then combined based on their relative 
contributions to the overall waste stream using RDRS data, thus producing statewide 
estimates of landfilled material by sorted material category. 

For all sectors, only deliveries of waste destined for disposal in landfills were eligible for 
sampling, including construction and demolition (C&D) debris. Loads of disaster debris 
(e.g., storm deadfall and soil), universal waste, material sent to be recycled or 
recovered, biosolids, designated waste, aggregates and soil set aside for beneficial use, 
alternative daily cover (ADC), and household hazardous waste (HHW) were not 
sampled and are excluded from the study. 

For the purposes of this study and throughout the report, the CalRecycle field team is 
referred to as “CalRecycle staff,” and the Cascadia-contracted field team is referred to 
as “contractor staff.” 

The following sections present further information regarding the methodology of each 
step. Appendix 1: Detailed Methodology (Section 1: Detailed Methodology) presents 
more detailed study design and methodology.

Estimating Overall Composition of Landfilled 
Material in California 
To gather the data necessary for estimating overall waste composition in the state, 
samples of waste were collected at California landfills and sorted based on covered 
material categories. 

Landfill Selection 
To maximize the collection of data representative of California, landfills that dispose of a 
higher proportion of the state’s waste stream were prioritized for inclusion in the study. 
Furthermore, to capture data across the four sectors, the landfills with the largest annual 
inflow tonnage that received material from the four sectors were prioritized for inclusion 
in the study. Participation by landfills in this study was voluntary. In total, 16 landfill sites 
participated (Table 1; Figure 1). The study was conducted over two sampling periods. 
Each period spanned roughly 14 calendar days with approximately two days at each 
site. Appendix 1: Detailed Methodology (Section 1.2: Facility Selection and Sample 
Allocation) provides additional details.

Sorting Categories 
In accordance with the Act, CalRecycle developed covered material categories (CMC), 
published July 1, 2024, which categorize single-use packaging and single-use plastic 
food service ware by material type and form, then added recyclability and compostability 
determinations for those categories in the January 1, 2025 updated publication. Each 
CMC is a combination of one material from within one of six classes (ceramic, glass, 
metal, paper and fiber, plastic, or wood or other organic material) and a particular type 
and form of that material (e.g. CMC Code 24_M4P identifies Class: Metal, Type: 
Aluminum, and Form: Aerosol Can). The categories individually apply to each 
detachable component of covered material. In addition to the six material classes, one 
additional material class —miscellaneous— was used for this study. It included a 
category for covered material discarded with a good still inside (e.g., partially filled bottle 
of lotion, a meal discarded in a plastic takeout container, or sausages discarded in their 
wrapper). 

To identify and sort items based on the covered material categories, 83 material sorting 
categories were established based on how materials are found at landfills (e.g., broken 
or contaminated) and feasibility of material identification and sorting in the field. During 
the study, contractor staff sorted each sample into one of the 83 categories from the 
Material Characterization Study Sorting List (Table 2) to provide material type 
composition data for each sample. The complete material sorting list with definitions and 
examples for each category is provided in Appendix 1 (Section 1.1, Table A1). 

Generally, each of the 83 material sorting categories included only one of the following 
types of materials: 

•  Covered material (i.e., single-use packaging and single-use plastic food service-

ware covered under the Act), 

•  Potentially reusable alternatives to covered material (e.g., reusable milk jug), and 
•  All other material that is not covered under the Act. 

Materials not covered under the Act were itemized into either a remainder category 
according to material class or sorted into the miscellaneous class. Remainder 
categories served as a catch-all for items, specific to class, that were not covered 
material. The miscellaneous class contained categories for hazardous materials, small 
items measuring 2 inches or smaller in at least two dimensions (i.e., mixed residue), 
and discarded covered material with a good (non-food) inside. 

Material sorting categories that included covered material not predominantly made of 
plastic were generally a combination of two CMCs — one for that material type without 
a plastic component and one for the same material type with a plastic component. For 
example, “Glass Bottles and Jars that are covered material” was a single sorting 
category but included two CMCs—one for Glass Bottles and Jars with a plastic 
component (CMC Code 24_G1P) and one for Glass Bottles and Jars without a plastic 
component (CMC Code 24_G1N). In these scenarios the combined CMC Code 
reflected in the material sorting list is a combination of the two CMCs, such as Code 
24_G1N/P.

The material types are specifically defined in Appendix 1: Detailed Methodology 
(Section 1.1: Sorting Categories List and Sorting Guidance, Table A1). Table A1 
provides sorting rules used in the field to identify the inclusion or exclusion of each item 
in the sorting categories. Further details on sample sorting and characterization are 
provided in Appendix 1: Detailed Methodology (Section 1.7: Sample Characterization).

Table 2. Material Characterization Study Sorting List  
The information contained in this table is a complete list of categories used to sort samples for the study. Each sorting 
category identifies a combination of material class, material type, and form. The first column in the table is a numeric 
count. The second column describes the material class (glass, ceramic, metal, paper and fiber, plastic, wood and other 
organic materials). The third column describes the material type, and the fourth column describes the form of the covered 
materials in that covered material category. The fifth column (Combined CMC Code) containing a code includes which 
covered material categories are included within each sorting category and refers to the covered material categories 
(CMCs) list published on July 1, 2024, pursuant to the Act. All sorting categories with a corresponding code starting with 
the “24_” prefix are categories specific to covered material. Additionally, in the Combined CMC Code column, the 
alphanumeric material code ends with either an “N” and/or a “P” indicating whether the item contains an inseparable 
plastic component (P) or contains no plastic component (N). An “N/P” indicates that the material form contains two 
covered material categories, one with and one without separable plastic components. Entries in the Combined CMC Code 
column with the following text mean: 

• 

• 
• 

“Mixture”: categories in which a covered material was jointly discarded with other material (e.g., food discarded in 
original packaging), 
“Potential reuse”: categories for packaging and food service ware that may be reusable or refillable, and 
“N/a”: remainder categories for materials other than covered material. 

The complete material sorting list with definitions and examples for each category is provided in Appendix 1 (Section 1.1, 
Table A1).

Vehicle Surveys 
As part of data collection, contractor staff conducted surveys at facilities to gather 
information on the sector of incoming vehicles, select specific vehicles for sampling, and 
collect additional data on the selected vehicles—such as the net weight of the load. The 
vehicle survey data were used to estimate the contribution of each waste sector at each 
participating facility to the overall waste sector throughout the state. 

More details on the vehicle surveys, data collected and subsequent analysis, and the 
vehicle selection process for sampling can be found in Appendix 1: Detailed 
Methodology (Section 1.5: Vehicle Surveys). 

Sample Collection and Sorting 
The contractor staff collected 313 waste samples across all sectors at the 16 landfills for 
composition analysis. An additional four samples were collected that did not meet the 
specifications for inclusion in the overall waste composition analysis but were still 
considered in the additional analyses completed by contractor staff (see section 
Additional Analysis Performed by Contractor Staff). 

From randomly identified residential route trucks, commercial route trucks, self-hauled 
loads, and transfer trailers, the contractor staff collected one sample weighing at least 
200 pounds from the selected vehicle. If, during a sampling day, the expected 
commercial vehicles or transfer trailers was anticipated to be fewer than needed to meet 
sampling targets, contractor staff collected two samples per vehicle for those types. 
Double sampling was not allowed from residential route trucks. Table 3 shows the 
sample distribution among the four sectors.

Additional Analysis Performed by Contractor Staff 
To collect additional data on the amount and type of covered material, contractor staff 
completed additional analyses on (1) covered material made of plastic of unknown resin 
type and (2) covered material disposed of with goods inside. This section describes 
details about the additional analyses. 

Covered Material Made of Plastic of Hard-to-Identify Resin Type 
Contractor staff sorted covered material made primarily of plastic that could not be 
readily identified in the field as a plastic resin of type #1 through #6 into one of two 
categories: (1) Other/Mixed Plastics Rigid Items (Count 68 in the material sorting list). or 
(2) Other/Mixed Plastics Flexible and Film Items (Count 69 in the material sorting list).

categories were recorded. Throughout the study, contractor staff collected a selection of 
items that fell into those categories for further analysis. Contractor staff applied the 
Cone and Quarter method (illustrated in Appendix 1: Section 1.7: Sample 
Characterization, Figure B2) to generate a random selection of material in those 
categories for resin identification analysis. Contractor staff sent the items to an off-site 
lab, Stina Inc., for analysis to identify the plastic resin type using resin spectroscopy: 
PET (#1), HDPE (#2), PVC (#3), LDPE (#4), PP (#5), PS (#6), and other or unknown 
resins. A total of 1,090 covered material items of unknown resin types were analyzed. 

Due to collection methods and differing methods of nomenclature, the resin analysis 
results were not associated with a specific sample, facility, or sector. As a result, these 
results are presented as stand-alone findings. The results of the resin analysis are 
described in Section Additional Analysis: Spectroscopic Analysis of Hard-to-Identify 
Resins, Tables 7a and 7b – Resin Composition Among Plastic Samples. 

Covered Material Disposed of with the Good Inside (Depackaging Analysis) 
Covered material disposed of with the good still inside (e.g., a partially filled bottle of 
lotion, a meal discarded in a plastic takeout container, or sausages discarded in their 
wrapper) was sorted into one of two categories: one for food discarded in covered 
material (Count 77 in the material sorting list), and one for all other goods discarded in 
covered material (Count 81 in the material sorting list). For a subset of materials in 
those two categories, contractor staff separated the covered material from the good. 
Contractor staff brushed, shook, scraped, spooned, and wiped the contaminant 
materials out of and off the covered packing material, collecting the contaminants in a 
bin. After separation and dry cleaning, the weight of the covered material was recorded, 
by material class. That data was used to estimate the proportional weight of the covered 
material in each of the two original categories. 

Additional Analysis Performed by CalRecycle 
Quality Control Sort 
CalRecycle staff conducted a quality control sort on all Remainder/Composite 
categories from the material sorting list to assess sorting accuracy. This process was 
executed as follows: (1) after contractor staff completed the initial sort into the 83 sorting 
categories, the materials in the Remainder/Composite categories were weighed; (2) 
next, for a subset of samples, CalRecycle staff conducted another sort of the materials 
in those categories to identify any covered materials that had been missed. The weights 
of any additional covered material discovered were later incorporated into the data, as 
described in the following section.

Calculation of Composition Data 
Calculating Final Material Composition 
To calculate the final material composition of a given sample (i.e., the percentage of 
each sorting category in a given sample), the following equation was applied: 

•  S = percentage by weight of a specific sorting category within a given sample 
•  M = weight of material within a specific sorting category from sort 
•  Q = weight of a material within a specific material class from the quality control 

  ×  100

𝑆𝑆 =  

[𝑀𝑀 + 𝑄𝑄(𝑖𝑖) + 𝐷𝐷(𝑖𝑖)]
𝑇𝑇

• 

sort 
i = percentage by weight that a specific sorting category accounts for within a 
material class (see next subsection for more details) 

•  D = weight of material within a specific material class from the depackaging 

analysis 

•  T = Total weight of all material in the sample 

Estimating percentage (i) 
Weight information on covered material disposed of, which was captured as part of the 
additional analysis on depackaging and the quality control sort, was collected at the 
material class level. To apply this weight to specific sorting categories, a study-wide 
estimate was made of the proportion each sorting category represented within its 
material class. Table A6 (Appendix 1, Section 2: Data Analysis) provides the average 
(mean) weight that each sorting category accounts for within a material class over the 
entire study period. To estimate these proportions, the following equation was used to 
estimate i for each sample, which was then averaged across the entire study.

  ×  100

This composition data, along with other information and data gathered during the study 
period, were used to extrapolate study findings to statewide levels, as detailed in the 
following subsections. 

Extrapolating Composition Data to Statewide 
Disposal 
Sample composition data, vehicle surveys, and CalRecycle’s RDRS database were 
integrated into one dataset to estimate the portion of California’s landfilled waste 
derived from each sector, by sorting category. First, the annual tons of solid waste 
landfill disposal reported in RDRS were summed to provide an estimate of total landfill 
disposal in 2024 (RDRS data accessed May 2025). The vehicle survey data were then 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
used to calculate the proportion of sampled material across the entire study by sector. 
These sector proportions were then multiplied by sample compositional data to 
calculate sector-scaled summary statistics (e.g., mean), which were sample 
compositional data adjusted by sector. These sector-scaled statistics were then 
multiplied by the total statewide tonnage to calculate estimated statewide disposal 
summary statistics for each sorting category. 

Disposal Estimates by Sorting Category 
Material characterization data were analyzed to provide two estimates for each of the 
sorting categories. This information is provided at the statewide level and for each 
sector. The two estimates include: 

1.  The average annual weight of landfilled material, expressed as mean; 

2.  The proportion of overall disposal (percent-by-weight) of each sorting category, 

expressed as mean. 

Data Considerations 
There are multiple methodological factors to consider when interpreting the findings of 
this study. Due to the nature of waste disposal, some rarer types of covered material 
(e.g., single-use ceramic packaging) may not have been collected due to the relatively 
small proportion of material sampled compared to total statewide disposal. Additionally, 
samples, especially those in the self-haul and commercial sectors, were often mostly 
homogenous. For example, a single randomly selected self-haul sample consisted 
almost entirely of concrete. These factors result in a data set with many CMCs that were 
rarely observed and where some samples were mostly homogenous. 

Additional details and explanations of these analyses can be found in Appendix 1: 
Section 1. 

Summary of Findings 
This section provides the statewide-level findings from the study. The first subsection 
presents the primary findings of this study—specifically, estimates of the proportions 
and amounts of covered material landfilled in California—by sorting category. The 
second subsection presents the findings from an additional analysis to identify the resin 
types of covered material for plastic items in which the resin type could not be identified 
in the field. 

The findings in this section, including the data tables, summarize all data collected in 
the study regarding covered material. Data tables reflecting results from the additional 
analyses of potentially reusable and Remainder/Composite categories can be found in 
Appendix 1. During the study, 4,613 pounds of covered material items were collected 
and sorted as the basis for these estimates. The quality control sort identified additional 
covered material within a total of 118 samples, totaling 237 pounds of additional 
characterized covered material. The depackaging analysis identified additional covered 
material within a total of 93 samples, totaling 173 pounds of additional characterized 

15 

covered material. In total, the Remainder/Composite (quality control) sort and 
depackaging analysis identified an additional 6% of covered material items by weight. 

Estimates of Statewide Disposal of All Material 
In 2024, an estimated 40,035,648 tons of material were sent for disposal in California 
landfills. Table 4 shows the disposal estimates for each sector based on vehicle surveys 
and RDRS statewide total disposal tonnage (RDRS data accessed May 2025). For each 
sector the percentage of disposal from that sector and the total disposal (tons) for 2024 
are shown.

Estimates of Statewide Disposal of Covered 
Material 
In 2024, an estimated 7,800,136 tons of covered material were disposed of in California 
landfills. Covered material accounted for 19.6% of total statewide disposal. By material 
class, paper and fiber was the most landfilled covered material, with an estimated 
3,896,497 tons disposed of, followed by plastic (see Table 5 for estimates of covered 
material by material class). 

All sorting categories with a corresponding code starting with “24_” are specific to 
covered material. Additionally, in the code column, the alphanumeric material code ends 
with either an “N” and/or a “P” indicating whether the item contains an inseparable 
plastic component (P) or contains no plastic component (N). An “N/P” indicates that the 
material form contains two covered materials, one with and one without separable 
plastic components. 

Materials within certain covered material categories were rarely found in samples, 
including: Ceramic all forms (24_C1N/P); Glass Other Forms (24_G2N/P); Plastic LDPE 
Bottles, Jugs, and Jars (24_P17P); Plastic PS Flexible and Film (24_P29P); Plastic PET 
Flexible and Film (24_P5P); Other/Mixed Organic Textile (24_WO3N/P); and 
Other/Mixed Organic Other Forms (24_WO4N/P). Since these items were rarely 
detected during sampling, it indicates their presence is likely rare in statewide disposal. 

Table 5 shows the estimates of covered material, by material class, landfilled in 
California in 2024, by weight (tons) and proportion of the total waste stream. Table 6 
shows estimates of the amounts of covered material, by sorting category, landfilled in 
California in 2024, by weight (tons), proportion of the total waste stream, and proportion 
of covered material disposed of.

Table 6. Estimates of Statewide Disposal of Covered Material in 2024 
Each row of the table contains data for each sorting category for covered material. The first four columns of this table 
identify the sorting category by combined CMC code, material class, material type, and material form. The fifth column is 
the annual average (mean) statewide disposal estimate in tons. The sixth column is the proportion of total statewide 
disposal that each sorting category accounts for.  All sorting categories with a corresponding code starting with “24_” are 
categories specific to covered material. Additionally, in the code column, the alphanumeric material code ends with either 
an “N” and/or a “P” indicating whether the item contains an inseparable plastic component (P) or contains no plastic 
component (N). An “N/P” indicates that the material form contains two covered materials, one with and one without 
separable plastic components. 

Statistical descriptions of variation and error (e.g., margin of error and standard deviation) are not included in the 
preliminary findings. Further statistical analysis will be conducted, and statistical descriptions will be provided in the final 
findings report.

Additional Analysis: Spectroscopic Analysis of 
Hard-to-Identify Resins 
Resin Composition Among Plastic Samples 
This section presents the results from resin analysis performed on covered materials 
that were sorted but whose dominant plastic type could not be readily distinguished by 
resin type in the field. Contractor staff sorted a total of 1,090 items from the following 
categories: Count 68 – Other/Mixed Plastics Rigid Items (527 individual items) and 
Count 69 – Other/Mixed Plastics Flexible and Film Items (563 individual items). These 
items were sent to Stina Inc. for identification using resin spectroscopy. 

The results from the resin analysis showed that (1) of the Other/Mixed Plastics Rigid 
items, HDPE (#2) and LDPE (#4) were the most prevalent resin types, accounting for 
nearly 50% of the 527 items analyzed (Table 7a); and (2) of the Other/Mixed Plastics 
Flexible and Film items, Other or Unknown Resins and PP (#5) were the most prevalent 
resin types, accounting for nearly 50% of the 563 items analyzed (Table 7b). 

Tables 7a and 7b contain information from the study sort and resin analysis completed 
on hard-to-identify resins. The first column denotes the resin type; the second column 
shows the number of instances the resin was found; and the third column indicates the 
percentage of resin prevalence. The sum of the values in the third column may not 
equal exactly 100% due to rounding. Within the sort, multiple covered material 
categories within each resin type are summed for the material forms “Rigid Items (Table 
7a)” and “Flexible and Film Items (Table 7b)”.

Additional Analysis: Refers to additional sorting and analysis performed by the 
contractor for: 

•  Covered material made primarily of plastic and could not be readily identified in 
the field as being composed of resin types #1 through #6 was sorted into one of 
two categories: (1) rigid items (Count 68 in the material sorting list) of other or 
unidentifiable plastic resin type, and (2) flexible and film items (Count 69 in the 
material sorting list) of other or unidentifiable plastic resin type. These samples 
were sent to an offsite laboratory for resin identification. 

•  Covered material disposed of with the good still inside (Count 81 in the material 
sorting list) or with food still inside (Count 77 in the material sorting list) were 
depackaged to obtain the weight of covered material without any contents. 

Contractor Staff: Refers to field staff under contract by CalRecycle to perform the 
sampling and sorting. This includes the primary contractor staff and any sub-contractor 
staff. 

Covered Material: Single-use packaging and single-use plastic food service ware 
covered under SB 54 (PRC Section 42041 (e)(1)). 

Covered Material Categories: Categories that include covered material of a similar 
type and form. Additional details regarding the Covered Material categories can be 
found on the main SB 54 Covered Material Categories List webpage. 

Landfilled: Material destined for final deposition in a landfill with no further processing. 
The following types of material were excluded from the study: (1) disaster debris (e.g., 
storm deadfall and soil), (2) universal waste, (3) material sent to be recycled or 
recovered, (4) biosolids, (5) designated waste, (6) aggregates and soil set aside for 
beneficial use, (7) alternative daily cover, and (8) household hazardous waste. 

Mean: Statistical description of the arithmetic average of a set of numbers. 

Sectors: A unique portion of the total waste stream that is determined by its particular 
generation, collection, or composition characteristics. Sectors are identified according to 
the source, or generator, of the waste (single-family or commercial), as well as how 
materials are delivered to waste sites (commercially collected or self-hauled). 

•  Franchised Commercial and Multi-family Residential (COM) materials are 

hauled by contracted or municipally operated vehicles in packer trucks and drop-
boxes. At least 80% of the material is generated at institutional, commercial, or 
industrial buildings such as businesses, schools, government offices, and other 
institutions, or multifamily residential buildings serviced with dumpsters. This is 
one of the four sectors of the waste stream collected for this study. 

•  Franchised Single-family Residential (RES) materials are hauled by 

contracted or municipally operated vehicles in packer trucks. At least 80% of the 
material is generated at residential buildings serviced with carts. This is one of 
the four sectors of the waste stream collected for this study.

•  Mixed waste (MIX) is commingled material either hauled in transfer trailers by 

contracted or municipally operated vehicles from a transfer station, or as loads of 
material recovery facility (MRF) residuals. This stream does not include loads 
from community drop-off locations. These loads do not come directly from a 
collection route or property; therefore, the generating sector is often 
unidentifiable. This is one of the four sectors of the waste stream collected for 
this study. 

•  Self-haul (SH) materials are hauled by vehicles not operated by a franchise or 
municipality, including waste from residential or non-residential sources. Self-
haul customers do not have a permit to operate as waste haulers. Municipal 
haulers, such as city road crews and parks departments, bringing waste from 
cleanups, are also included in this stream. This is one of the four sectors of the 
waste stream collected for this study. 

Sort: For this study, material sent to landfills for disposal was categorized based on the 
study sorting list. The material initially categorized into each of the 83 sorting categories 
included only one of the following types of materials: (1) Covered material (i.e., single-
use packaging and single-use plastic food service ware covered under the Act); (2) 
Potentially reusable alternatives to covered material (e.g., reusable milk jug); and (3) All 
other material not covered under the Act, classified as Remainder/Composite. This 
activity was conducted by the contractor staff. For this study, materials that were in the 
Remainder/Composite categories from the sort were subject to additional quality control 
sort by CalRecycle staff. 

Material sorting list: For this study, the material sorting list represents the material 
sorting categories used by contractor staff to conduct the study. The sorting list was 
aligned to covered material categories.
