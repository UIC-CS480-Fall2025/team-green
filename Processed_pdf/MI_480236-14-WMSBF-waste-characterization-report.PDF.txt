org anizations for their suppor t,    

 without which, this project would not be possible .

IN BRIEF   

This study provides information and analysis on the composition of municipal solid waste currently 
landfilled and incinerated in Michigan, and the economic value of this material. 

We estimate total material value of Michigan MSW disposed in landfills and incinerators of as much 
as $368 million per year.  If all of this material was recovered and sold to the market it would have 
an estimated total economic impact of up to $399 million per year, and employment impact of 
up 2,619 jobs.  

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RECYCLING RATE IMPROVEMENT 

1.  Aggressively promote efforts to increase recovery of corrugated cardboard, prioritizing commercial 

audiences.   

2.  Support efforts to increase availability and usage of conventional recycling programs with a goal to 

increase recovery of non-corrugated paper products, metal, and high-value plastic resins HDPE and PET.   

3.  Through recovery or source reduction, decrease the quantity of electronic waste disposed of in Michigan 

landfills by half.   

4.  Promote source reduction and diversion of food waste.   
5.  Promote source reduction of low-value plastic resins.   
6.  Initiate efforts to increase recycling channels for textiles and promote availability of textile recycling.   
7.  Educate the public on the financial difficulties of recycling and waste diversion.   
8.  Pursue opportunities for further study highlighted in this report.

About this Study  
In his 2012 special message on energy and the environment Governor Rick Snyder acknowledged 
the low recycling rate in Michigan and committed to creating a plan to improve that rate. In 
response, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) convened a stakeholder 
workgroup to begin a dialog to advance recycling in Michigan. One finding of that group was a need 
for more data and information to inform state and local decision makers.  

A total of $250,000 in Community Pollution Prevention Grant Program funds were awarded to 
support three projects to collect data on Michigan’s recycling rate. Projects were meant to provide 
information on the percentage of population with convenient access to recycling, places with high 
performing recycling programs, information on composition of municipal solid waste currently 
landfilled and incinerated, and the economic value of this material.  

This study provides information and analysis on the composition of municipal solid waste currently 
landfilled and incinerated in Michigan, and the economic value of this material.  Its findings are 
derived entirely from field studies, verifiable market prices for recycled commodities, and peer-
reviewed academic studies. 

In May 2014 the Michigan Recycling Coalition introduced the Michigan Recycling Index in its 
report, Measuring Recycling in the State of Michigan, which provided information on the percentage of the 
population with convenient access to recycling and general information on the performance of the 
recycling industry.  A project of the Northeast Michigan Council of Governments will report further 
information on high-performing recycling programs, the composition of municipal solid waste and 
the economic impact of the recycling industry.  Consulting firm Resource Recycling Systems is the 
primary author of both reports. 

While it should be taken in context of the other data-gathering projects, this study was produced 
independently and is not necessarily intended as a complementary document.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The economically practical diversion of otherwise useful solid waste from landfills and incinerators 
is a nearly universal environmental concern.  Recycling is a ubiquitous entry point for sustainability 
initiatives across all scales, from homes and commercial offices to communities and industry.  

In his 2012 special message on energy and the environment Governor Rick Snyder acknowledged 
the low recycling rate in Michigan and committed to creating a plan to improve that rate. In 
response, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) convened a stakeholder 
workgroup to begin a dialog to advance recycling in Michigan. One finding of that group was a need 
for more data and information to inform state and local decision makers.  

This study provides information and analysis on the composition of municipal solid waste currently 
landfilled and incinerated in Michigan, and the economic value of this material.  Its findings are 
derived from field studies, verifiable market prices for recycled commodities, peer-reviewed 
academic studies and similar reports from other Great Lakes states.  

The Michigan Municipal Solid Waste Characterization and Valuation Study performed statistically 
significant waste sorts at sites regionally and statewide, and through this provided an economic 
valuation for waste diversion in terms of real material value, job creation, and other positive 
economic and environmental impacts.  

Waste Characterization Sorting Events 

Sample loads were sorted by hand into 22 different categories, weighed and returned to the waste 
stream.  All sorting occurred within the tipping area of the landfill, incinerator or transfer station.  

Sorting categories were defined in context of waste diversion potential through recycling and 
composting.  As such, material definitions are not universally consistent with all waste data.

Total Michigan MSW Landfilled and Incinerated 

Michigan landfills report received volume to MDEQ on an annual basis.  Based on these regulatory 
fillings there were 7,475,259 tons of MSW landfilled during the 2013-2014 fiscal year that came from 
Michigan. In addition, the Kent County Waste to Energy Facility in Grand Rapids and the Detroit 
Renewable Power facility in Detroit incinerated about 1,386,982 tons of MSW during 2014.  
Between these two sources we estimate the state generates 8,862,241 tons of MSW available for 
screening for recycling. 

Composition Results  

The first objective of this study was to provide an estimate of the statewide aggregate mixed 
municipal solid waste composition for Michigan.  These results are detailed in the following figures:

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is clear that the Snyder Administration’s goal of doubling the recycling rate is attainable with 
sufficient time and resources.  Most material currently being disposed of through landfills and 
incinerators could be recycled or composted in most metropolitan communities without great 
difficulty.  As shown in the figure below, a plurality of material can be recycled through any 
commonly available recycling service (numbered plastic, glass, paper, metal).   

An additional 35% could be composted, including food and yard waste, non-recyclable, compostable 
paper and other miscellaneous organic material.  With some effort, most other materials could be 
recycled in many Michigan communities, including textiles, bulk items, electronic waste, soil, and 
household hazardous waste.

Comparison with Other Great Lakes States 

Michigan is the last of the Great Lakes states to conduct a field study on MSW disposal 
characterization.  In order to quantify potential differences between the state’s characterization and 
that of its neighboring states we have reviewed characterization studies for Illinois (2015), Minnesota 
(2013), Indiana (2012), Wisconsin (2009) and Ohio (2004).  We have also included data from the US 
EPA’s most recent MSW characterization report from 2012, which was not generated from waste 
sorts.  For comparison with the two most recent studies, Illinois reports a 38% recycling rate, 
Minnesota 68%, whereas Michigan has a 15% recycling rate, according to the Michigan Recycling 
Index. 

  Michigan has a higher percentage of paper material disposed than the high-performing 

states.  Paper is generally believed to be one of the more efficient materials to recycle, so it 
would be reasonable to assume that improvements would be most achievable in this 
category, and that high-performing state programs would have a lower percentage of this 
material than low-performing programs.  

  Michigan has a lower percentage of plastic than all of the Great Lakes states.  Plastic is 

generally believed to be more difficult to recycle, so it would be reasonable to assume that 
high-performing programs would have a higher percentage of material in this category, 
compared to lower percentages of materials less difficult to recycle.  

  Minnesota is the only Great Lakes state with a lower percentage of paper than plastic.  It is 

also the highest performing state, with a stated recycling rate of 68%.    

  Michigan has a lower percentage of organic material.  Organics are the most plentiful waste 

and not particularly easy to recycle, so it would be reasonable to assume that a high-
performing state would have a higher percentage of material in this category.

Material Valuation 

A primary benefit of increased recycling is the economic value found from reclaiming these 
resources and selling them to the market.  We have collected commodity prices for each of our 
composition categories and calculated the value of the material currently being disposed.  Our 
process for defining material value is simple and straight-forward:  What will the market pay for a 
ton of the material in Michigan?    

Only half of the 22 categories analyzed in the characterization have any material value to the market.

Composition:  Mean percentage of available material by weight. 
Material Value:  High percentage of aggregate value of available material according to verifiable commodity prices. 
Net Recycling Value:  High estimate of value per ton plus indirect benefits, minus processing costs.  

Note: Subtotals for the mean percentages may not equal the sum of the mean percentages due to rounding. Confidence 
intervals for primary categories and subcategories are calculated independently. 

Ideally, efforts to promote recycling or composting improvements would prioritize those with the 
highest composition and net recycling value.    

While there is an environmental or social case for promoting recovery of all MSW materials, there is 
no economic value in recovering many materials based on current economic conditions.

We should highlight emphatically that the material values used in this report are volatile and prone 
to change.  At the time we conducted our research commodity prices were experiencing sharp 
declines.  The situation will hopefully improve over time.  

Due largely to the presence of HDPE plastic, plastic packaging would offer the most aggregate 
material value to the state.  This is followed by corrugated cardboard, ferrous metal, aluminum and 
textiles, then all other materials. 

One material exemplifies a high-value, high-quantity scenario: corrugated cardboard.  Though not as 
prominent, textiles and plastic packaging offer a similar opportunity, though the latter is likely 
overstated due to the comingling of HDPE with lesser value plastic resins.   

Mixed paper is also unique in that it has the largest quantity of available material among any category 
with a market value.  Though it is the lowest value per ton of any of the valuable materials, its large 
quantity would suggest it is “low-hanging fruit” for diversion improvements.  

Employment Impact 

Increasing recycling will create jobs in Michigan. The value of recyclable materials diverted from 
landfills and incinerators to markets will eventually end up with households through increased 
employment and profits by waste haulers and recycling processors, and also through purchases of 
goods and services to support these businesses.  

Since very little virgin material (particularly plastics and metals) is extracted in Michigan, we assume 
all of the revenues from the sale of recyclables can be counted as new household spending. Using 
RIMS multipliers for Kent County from 2006 (adjusting the jobs multiplier per million dollars by 
inflation since 2006), we find extracting recycling from the MSW stream would create between 2,085 
and 2,619 full time equivalent jobs in Michigan with a total effect of between $317 and $399 million 
dollars.

We estimate total material value of Michigan MSW disposed in landfills and incinerators of as much 
as $368 million.  If all of this material was recovered and sold to the market it would have an 
estimated total economic impact of up to $399 million.

Recommendations 

Efforts to increase the recycling rate in Michigan should first focus on the 42% of materials that 
have market value, which would include all standard recyclable commodities but glass, plus textiles. 

We argue that doubling the recycling rate itself is an arbitrary goal, albeit a worthwhile motivational 
tool.  A potentially better metric would be the percentage of material of value in the waste stream, 
with a goal of reducing this to zero.   

Keeping to the stated goal of doubling the Michigan recycling rate to 30%, our findings do provide a 
rough outline for how that might be best achieved.  In total, the state must increase the quantity of 
diverted material by approximately 1.5 million tons per year through a combination of recovery and 
source reduction.      

1.  Aggressively promote efforts to increase recovery of corrugated cardboard, prioritizing 
commercial audiences.  This is an ideal opportunity and should be considered “low-hanging 
fruit.”  Corrugated cardboard is among the state’s highest volume materials.  It is perhaps the 
easiest material to recycle, and boasts a net recycling value of $55 per ton, the highest return 
among high-volume material. The market for the material is well-developed and not likely to 
experience any significant technological or market upheavals in the foreseeable future.   

2.  Support efforts to increase availability and usage of conventional recycling programs 

with a goal to increase recovery of non-corrugated paper products, metal, and high-value 
plastic resins HDPE and PET.  As demonstrated in the economic analysis section, there are a 
limited number of recyclable commodities that can be recycled without subsidy, and fewer still in 
high demand.  Efforts to increase recycling in Michigan should prioritize diverting materials of 
value from the waste stream.    

3.  Through recovery or source reduction, decrease the quantity of electronic waste 

disposed of in Michigan landfills by half.  As a percentage of MSW, Michigan disposes twice 
the amount of electronic waste as any of its neighboring states.  This would represent a dramatic 
improvement, considering that the state currently recycles just 9% of electronic waste.  A landfill 
ban could potentially achieve this.   

4.  Promote source reduction and diversion of food waste.  Food waste is the most prevalent 
material found in Michigan MSW.  It is a prime candidate for source reduction, which could be 
achieved through commercial efficiencies or consumer behavior change.  As an alternative, 
feeding the hungry is a universally positive diversion opportunity.  Composting, agriculture and 
renewable energy also offer diversion opportunities for consideration.    

5.  Promote source reduction of low-value plastic resins.  Michigan recycles 5% of plastic 

volumes currently, and it seems likely that the highest concentration of that is occurring with 
high-value, easy-to-recycle materials such as PET and HDPE.  Low-value resins are notoriously 
difficult to recycle due to logistical and financial challenges, which limits the potential 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effectiveness of efforts to improve recycling of those commodities.  From a quantity standpoint, 
if the state were to quadruple its plastic recycling performance it would only increase the state’s 
recycling rate by a few percentage points.   

Strategies intended to promote packaging efficiency, reusable products and other source 
reduction tactics could have a more noticeable impact on Michigan’s MSW characterization and 
recycling rate.   

As an alternative, the state might pursue game-changing market development activities. 

6.  Initiate efforts to increase recycling channels for textiles and promote availability of 

textile recycling.  Though a minor impact in terms of aggregate recycling rate, this would have 
a significant impact on the total value of materials recovered.  This opportunity deserves greater 
attention than what it is currently receiving.  There is also clear potential for improvement:  
Michigan’s textile recycling rate (9%) is half that of Illinois (20%). 

7.  Educate the public on the financial difficulties of recycling and waste diversion.  The 
majority of MSW disposed in Michigan landfills and incinerators has no market value as an 
unprocessed commodity.       

8.  Pursue opportunities for further study highlighted in this report. 

  Performance of yard waste ban in context of high-concentration of non-banned 

materials that would be classified as yard waste.  

  Recovery rate of deposited containers in context of discrepancies suggested in this report 

between number of deposited containers being disposed and recovered.  

  Repeat characterization study within three to five years. The results reported in this study 
represent a baseline, the state’s first derived from field study and verifiable commodity 
prices.  A repeat study will allow for the visualization of improvements over time, both 
in recycling performance and in economic conditions.  That is when the full value of this 
activity will be realized, and a timely opportunity given groundswell of efforts to increase 
recycling in Michigan in the near future.

1-1: INTRODUCTION  

The economically practical diversion of otherwise useful solid waste from landfills and incinerators 
is a universal environmental concern in the state.  Recycling is a ubiquitous entry point for 
sustainability initiatives across all scales, from homes and commercial offices to communities and 
industry.  Even private enterprises that profit from landfill volumes recognize the value of diversion 
and are actively engaged in developing programs to monetize such efforts.  The environmental and 
economic value of recycling in Michigan has been well documented and consistently affirmed.  

However, there is limited data available on the composition of solid waste for decision makers to 
evaluate the impact of recycling programs or the feasibility of public or private investments in new 
or expanded capacity.  In West Michigan, administrators of recycling and composting programs are 
seeking waste characterization data to enhance educational programming and promotions to 
consumers and commercial enterprises, for evaluation, and for strategic decision making.  It could 
prove critical in providing a business case support for strategic growth and access to capital, 
particularly for those in emerging fields such as composting and electronics recycling.  In Muskegon, 
such data would help inform feasibility for a major potential public infrastructure investment.   

In general, local and state decision makers require a characterization benchmark to determine the 
value of potential new and expanded recycling streams, performance of programs, and the 
environmental and economic costs of solid waste.  Private-industry sustainability professionals and 
recyclers desire this knowledge to better communicate and support the value of landfill avoidance 
efforts.  It is particularly relevant at this time given the Snyder administration’s stated goal of 
increasing the recycling rate to 30% by 2016, as characterization data would help inform investments 
toward that goal. 

A statewide waste characterization study has never been performed in Michigan using statistically 
significant waste sorts at landfills, transfer stations and/or incinerators.  Nor has a regional study 
been performed in West Michigan.  Further, existing estimates concerning the potential economic 
value of materials currently being landfilled or incinerated are not based on characterization or actual 
market values of recycled commodities.  There is opportunity to provide decision-makers and 
recycling advocates a more accurate value.  

The Michigan Municipal Solid Waste Characterization and Valuation Study performed statistically 
significant waste sorts at sites regionally and statewide, and through this provided an economic 
valuation for divergence in terms of real material value, job creation, and other positive economic 
and environmental impacts.

The following details the results of that initiative according to its five objectives: 

  Determine composition of Michigan MSW now being disposed of in landfills and 

incinerators 

  Compare the composition of Michigan’s MSW to the MSW waste of other Midwest states 
  Complete an economic analysis of MSW composition 
  Complete an assessment of hazardous waste concerns for electronic materials sent to landfill 
  Complete an evaluation of West Michigan composition and local concerns 

1-2 DEFINITIONS 

Confidence intervals – The lower and upper confidence intervals indicate the likelihood that the 
population mean falls close to the sample mean as defined by the standard.  For comparison with 
other studies, and in accordance with industry standards, the lower and upper bounds throughout 
this report have been calculated at a 90 percent level of confidence. The 90 percent confidence 
intervals define the upper and lower bounds for which we can be 90 percent confident that the 
particular material category’s mean value will fall. If the confidence intervals are “wide” for a 
material category, it means there was greater variability of that material between samples. 

Municipal Solid Waste – more commonly known as trash or garbage, consists of everyday items 
we use and then throw away, such as product packaging, yard waste, furniture, clothing, bottles, 
food scraps, newspapers, appliances, paint, and batteries. This comes from our homes, schools, 
hospitals, and businesses.  In its annual solid waste report the MDEQ refers to this waste stream as 
Municipal and Commercial Waste.  For purposes of this study, we will treat the two terms as 
synonyms.  Abbreviated as MSW. 

Mean – The mean is calculated as the average composition of each material category (or primary 
material category) expressed as a percentage of the total amount of material within that sample set.  

MSW Characterization – evaluation of the composition and quantity of material in MSW. 

Standard Deviation – measure of dispersion in a frequency distribution, equal to the square root of 
the mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic mean of the distribution. 

Z Score – a statistical measurement of a score's relationship to the mean in a group of scores. A Z-
score of 0 means the score is the same as the mean.  A Z-score can be positive or negative, 
indicating whether it is above or below the mean and by how many standard deviations.

1-3 MICHIGAN MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE   

Michigan landfills report received volume to MDEQ on annual basis.  Based on these regulatory 
fillings there were 7,475,259 tons of MSW landfilled during the 2013-2014 fiscal year that came from 
Michigan.  Between the Kent County Waste to Energy Facility in Grand Rapids and the Detroit 
Renewable Power facility in Detroit there were about 1,386,982 tons of MSW incinerated during 
2014 (reported as 182,482 tons per year and 3,300 tons per day, respectively).  

The landfill estimates omit incinerator ash (including it would double count that material as available 
for recycling), MSW imported from other states (it would be difficult to screen for recyclables and 
likely already has been), and MSW exported to other states (the number is not available). The two 
incinerators do not process out-of-state MSW.    

Between these two sources we estimate the state generates 8,862,241 tons of MSW available for 
screening for recycling.  MDEQ has previously published an estimate of 8,026,443 tons of landfilled 
and incinerated MSW, which is the number that appears in the 2015 Michigan Recycling Index 
report.  In the valuation analysis in Section 4 we use an aggregate of these two numbers.

Michigan landfills report volumes received in cubic yards.  To aid in comparing other states’ waste to 
Michigan’s, the MDEQ uses a simple conversion of 3 cubic yards equals 1 ton of waste.  For the 
purposes of simplicity and consistency we have followed this precedent.

As will be highlighted in the characterization and valuation discussions later in this report, it is 
important to note that approximately 16% of Michigan’s MSW is processed through incineration, as 
that does impact projections for the amount of available material to be recycled.  At both facilities, 
ferrous metals are reclaimed from incinerator ash in significant volumes.

1-4 STUDY DESIGN 

The project consisted of two major research tasks: characterization and valuation.  The 
characterization included waste sorts at eight sites throughout Michigan, six of those split between 
four West Michigan counties, and two further afield in Northern and Southeast Michigan.  Civil 
engineering firm Fishbeck, Thompson, Carr & Huber was contracted to develop a sorting protocol 
and safety guidelines, which would be based primarily on the methodology detailed in the 
professional standard ASTM D5231-92 (2008) Standard Test Method for Determination of the 
Composition of Unprocessed Municipal Solid Waste. 

MDEQ personnel consulted on applicable regulations for municipal solid waste, while the WMSBF 
Waste Task Force provided guidance on various process decisions.  The protocol can be found after 
the report in Appendix B. Multiple amendments were made to the protocol in field as questions and 
concerns emerged.  These are also documented in Appendix B. 

Sort Size and Selection 

Per the standard, a governing component was used to determine the number of random samples 
necessary to achieve the desired precision level.  This is described further in Appendix A.  Due to its 
historical and demographic consistency, corrugated cardboard was selected as the governing 
component, requiring 10 samples per site. 

At the beginning of each sorting day three to 10 compactor trucks were chosen via a random 
number generator.  For instance, if the goal for the day was to sort three trucks and the number 
generator pulled 1, 7, and 15, then the first, seventh and fifteenth trucks would be sampled.  One 
sorting sample of approximately 300 lbs was taken from each vehicle selected.  Samples were taken 
via front loader, selected from a quadrant of the load pile by a coin-flip methodology that varied 
slightly as a function of load size. 

Qualifying vehicles were compactor trucks serving residential or commercial route customers.  
Drivers were queried by research staff on the communities they served and the type of load.  Site 
staff recorded truck weights.  Detailed truck information can be found in Appendix A.      

Host sites were volunteered from representative operators on the WMSBF Solid Waste Task Force.

Seasonality and Timing 

Characterization studies of similar states have concluded that seasonal differences in the 
composition of the MSW stream are not statistically significant. Historically, the most seasonably 
variable material in the MSW stream is yard waste, and because Michigan has comprehensive yard 
waste collection and diversion programs in place, backed by a ban on certain yard wastes such as 
yard clippings, the extent of seasonal differences in the MSW composition is estimated to be 
minimal.  As a result, all sampling and sorting was conducted in the summer of 2015, as opposed to 
collecting data at various times throughout the year.  

In scheduling the sorts, we were careful to avoid days in which waste composition or volume was 
likely to deviate from typical occurrence.  All sorts were done on non-holiday weekdays.  One sort 
occurred mid-week during a week that included a holiday (Ottawa Farms: Memorial Day).  The table 
below depicts the schedule and quantities of mixed municipal solid waste sorted at each of the host 
sites.

Sorting Methodology 

Sample loads were sorted by hand into 22 different categories (Table 1-4), weighed and returned to 
the waste stream.  All sorting occurred within the tipping area of the landfill, incinerator or transfer 
station. Scavenging rules and impracticality prevented recycling of sampled materials.  

Sorting categories were defined in context of waste diversion potential through recycling and 
composting.  As such, material definitions are not universally consistent with waste data provided in 
other studies.  For instance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain state reports 
would classify soiled napkins as paper.  Given that this material is not recycled as a paper product 
through any recycler in Michigan, but could be composted, we have classified it as “Other Organic.”  
A handful of other such variations exist, and are discussed further in Section 2. 

When calculating its MSW disposal reports, the EPA distinguishes between material and product, 
which allows for a neater classification of problem materials.  Those reports are generated from 
market data and regulatory filings, not in-field waste sorts.  The ASTM standard for waste sorts does 
not distinguish between materials and products.     

Several adjustments were made to category definitions and the sorting process in the field as 
unanticipated situations emerged.  The vast majority of these concerned the discovery of materials 
that challenged existing definitions.  Some of the more prominent examples included cigarette butts, 
dirt, house plants, and textiles.  Two categories were added on the second day of the first sort:  
textiles and soil. 

Sorter Staffing 

Waste sort teams were comprised of students and recent graduates from WMSBF member colleges 
and universities.  Six research fellows were hired for a two-month period from May to June 2015.  
This core group was supplemented by day laborers, host-site employees and WMSBF staff members 
as available and necessary.  Research fellows also supported WMSBF project supervisors with 
logistical preparations.  Staff from FTCH was also on-site for four of the eight sort events.  

All sorters and supervisors received a safety orientation for the project protocol, and another 
orientation for each individual site.  No volunteers were used.

Data Analysis  

Findings from each site were entered into a statistical model defined by the standard and refined by 
FTCH.  The model calculates the mean and the 90% confidence intervals for individual material 
categories for each sorting event and in the aggregate.  

The mean represents the mathematical average or average percent of material composing the MSW 
stream by weight.  The confidence interval is an expression of accuracy.  It provides the upper and 
lower limits of the “actual” mean for all the MSW received at the participating facility based upon 
the sorting and sampling observations of the sampled materials.  For example, the 90% confidence 
interval represents that there is a 90% level of confidence that the true population mean falls within 
the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.  The 90% confidence interval is the generally 
accepted industry standard for solid waste composition studies.  In general, the more samples that 
are sorted, the narrower the confidence interval becomes for a given level of confidence.  Given our 
sample sizes, narrower confidence intervals indicate less variability in the data.  

The statewide composition is a function of the means of the eight sites. Adjustments were not made 
to manipulate the data according to demographic differences, such as weighting the sites by 
population or their percentage contributions to total Michigan MSW.  A transcription error caused 
one sample to be omitted from statewide calculations (South Kent Sample 7).     

There are several factors that may influence the actual potential for diversion: 

  By definition, all MSW is contaminated from a recycling perspective.  We have assumed that 
all recyclable materials would be diverted in a clean and dry state.  It is reasonable to assume 
that if this material is diverted its value would be impacted by contamination to the same 
extent or more as material currently being recycled.  

  Though we have tried to separate food waste from its packaging, and vice versa, this could 

 

not be done with precision in the field.  There exists the possibility that weights for 
recyclable packaging may be overstated slightly by the presence of material that would be 
washed away if the product were recycled. 
In limited instances, packaging was sorted into food waste when it would have been 
impractical to separate the two in field, such as unopened canned goods.  In these situations, 
packaging weights would have been understated, while food waste was overstated.   
  Materials were sorted by their ability to be recycled in the state that they were disposed.  
Items containing recyclable material requiring significant disassembly to be recycled were 
classified as Non-Recyclable Inorganic Waste, or Bulk Items, whichever was appropriate. 
  Fine soil mixes and dirt proved the most challenging material to classify.  With the exception 
of loads containing obvious fill dirt, which was classified as Soil, and dirt from the landfill, 
which was excluded, it was not possible to identify the origin of dirt and dirt-like material.  
Given that it most often occurred in conjunction with Yard Waste, it was most often 
included in that category, but this was unfortunately not done in a consistent manner.  As 
such, this may have overstated weights for Yard Waste.  

  Coffee grounds were classified as Other Organic through a decision in the field, as opposed 

to Food Waste.

2-2 COMPOSITION FINDINGS 

Several valuable insights were revealed through the composition analysis.  Perhaps most importantly, 
it became clear that the Snyder Administration’s goal of doubling the recycling rate is attainable with 
sufficient time and resources.  Most material currently being disposed of through landfills and 
incinerators could be recycled or composted in most metropolitan communities without great 
difficulty.  As shown in Figure 2-6, a plurality of material can be recycled through any commonly 
available recycling service (glass, paper, metal, most plastic).  An additional 35% could be 
composted, including compostable paper, food waste, soil, wood and yard waste. With some effort, 
most other materials could be recycled in many Michigan communities, including textiles, bulk 
items/furniture, soil, and household hazardous waste.   

Only 15.4% of Michigan waste is impractical or extremely difficult to recycle, including those 
materials that require special effort for disassembly and that lack opportunities for recycling:  
polystyrene foam and miscellaneous inorganic waste.  Polystyrene foam will be discussed in greater 
depth in Section 5.  A portion of inorganic waste could be recycled through extraordinary 
disassembly, or niche services such as Terracycle, which allows consumers to mail-in miscellaneous 
consumer products and packaging, which we do not believe are reasonable expectations for the 
average consumer or business.  

34 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Considerations: Yard Waste  

Given the state’s landfill ban on yard clippings, we had not expected to find that it represented 5% 
of Michigan MSW.  This is particularly alarming when taken in context of the Michigan Recycling 
Index, which would suggest that less yard waste was being recycled than was being disposed 
(422,103 tons of yard waste disposed vs. 378,000 tons organic waste recycled), but the results are 
deceptive. 

This study should not be used to validate or invalidate arguments for or against the state’s landfill 
ban.  While there were certainly banned wastes observed in sort samples, these were generally 
considered in de minimis.   The majority of material classified as yard waste would not have fit the 
definition of a banned waste under the law.  Among other material, this would have included fine 
soil mixes and dirt that were difficult to distinguish from plant material.  Obvious fill dirt was 
counted in a separate category after experiencing larger than expected volumes during the first sort 
event, a change made out of consideration for how a large percentage of yard waste would be 
perceived in context of the yard clippings ban.  

As it was well understood that yard waste would not have an impact on the economic value of 
recyclable material, limited adjustments were made to the study methodology to create a consistent 
and usable protocol regarding the measurement of yard waste.  An evaluation on the effectiveness of 
the ban or state of yard waste diversion was not an objective of this project.  It is an opportunity for 
further study. 

Considerations: Ferrous Metal Reclaimed from Incinerator Ash 

Approximately 16% of Michigan’s MSW is processed through the state’s two waste-to-energy 
facilities.  Ferrous metals are reclaimed from incinerator ash in significant volumes between the two 
some 39,000 tons at Detroit Renewable Power and 3,153 tons at Kent County Waste to Energy.  
These quantities are in line with our composition expectations for the quantity of ferrous metal that 
would be found in MSW material disposed of at Michigan incinerators.   

Given this, it becomes necessary to define what constitutes disposal of Michigan MSW.  For the 
purposes of determining characterization we have chosen to count all materials that arrive on the 
tipping floor as part of composition and quantity, which is consistent to MDEQ regulatory 
definitions and facility scavenging rules.  Regardless, these quantities would not have a meaningful 
impact on the statewide composition, though it could have a meaningful impact on valuation, which 
will be discussed in Section 4. 

Considerations: Deposit Containers 

For our purposes, we have separated beverage containers redeemable for a $0.10 deposit-return in 
Michigan from the containers’ material composition (aluminum, glass, plastic).  This is discussed 
further in Section 5.      

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consumables and Non-Durable Product Materials 

The majority of disposed MSW material is generated from single or limited-use product purchases 
and activities.  The figure below describes the composition of disposed MSW generated by product.   

Our methodology did not allow us to define this with the same level of precision found in EPA 
MSW estimates, as several material categories contained a mix of durable and nondurable goods. 
Results are consistent with recent EPA estimates that 50.5% of MSW generation is from nondurable 
goods, containers and packaging, plus 14.5% from food waste.  

Strategies intended to promote packaging efficiency and reusable products could have a noteworthy 
impact on Michigan’s MSW characterization and recycling rate.   

36 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commercial and Residential Composition 

The following tables define composition of statewide MSW disposed by commercial or residential 
generation.  Study samples were split approximately evenly between commercial (29), residential (26) 
and mixed (24) route loads.  As the sample size was much smaller for these populations than that of 
the statewide composition, the information should not be deemed as equally reliable.

To ascertain statistically significant differences between the specific material types we calculated the 
variances between the two and flagged any with a deviation of more than 0.5.  This is shown in 
Figure 2-8. 

For the most part the results fit common-sense expectations for differences between commercial 
and residential waste.  Residential routes had a higher composition of food waste, soil, glass, bulk 
items and plastic packaging.  Commercial routes had a higher composition of corrugated cardboard. 

Of those, the variance for corrugated cardboard is by far the highest, and also the most noteworthy 
item in this data set.  Across all audiences corrugated cardboard represents 8.4% of MSW disposed 
in the state.  After mixed paper, it is the largest concentration of material that has market value – but 
it has much lower quantities among residential users, nearly half of what is found on commercial 
routes.  Targeting the business sector for specific improvements in corrugated cardboard diversion 
could be prove worthwhile, more so than any other material.

2-3 CONTEXT WITH MICHIGAN RECYCLING INDEX   

The Michigan Recycling Index published in spring 2015 by Michigan Recycling Coalition and 
MDEQ provides an opportunity for further context of statewide MSW characterization.  Given the 
voluntary nature of the MRI and the lack of confidence its authors exhibit in its data, these 
projections should be taken with a grain of salt.    

The table below reconciles the characterization of statewide MSW detailed in this report with the 
estimated quantities of MSW diverted detailed in the MRI. For the purpose of consistency total 
MSW disposed is the quantity reported in the MRI.

No adjustments were made to account for differences in approach for metals reclaimed from 
incinerators and in counting deposited beverage containers.  Quantities were not sufficient to 
meaningfully impact the result.    

This table is not presented to prove the 15% Michigan MSW recycling rate reported in the MRI and 
previously estimated by MDEQ.  It serves only to quantify recycling performance in individual 
material categories, based on the published results of the MRI. Some understanding of the 
characterization of MSW recovered is necessary if we are to make conclusions or recommendations 
on improvements using MSW disposal data.   

This Michigan MSW disposal characterization report is designed to help provide understanding of 
MSW contents, not data on recycling performance.  Further information on recycled quantities is 
necessary to calculate a recycling rate, which has some value in context of national metrics and in 
comparison with other states.  Recycling program performance could be measured by performing 
additional characterization studies in the future, allowing for changes in composition and quantities 
to be tracked over time.

3-1 COMPARISON WITH OTHER GREAT LAKES STATES 

Michigan is the last of the Great Lakes states to conduct a field study on MSW disposal 
characterization.  In order to quantify potential differences between the state’s characterization and 
that of its neighboring states we have reviewed characterization studies for Illinois (2015), Minnesota 
(2013), Indiana (2012), Wisconsin (2009) and Ohio (2004).  We have also included data from the US 
EPA’s most recent MSW characterization report from 2012. 

All of the statewide studies followed similar methodologies from a sorting standpoint, but differed 
slightly by category definition and significantly in scope.  Care was taken to ensure standard 
definitions of material disposed, which resulted in reclassification of several materials in other 
reports.  As such the values shown in the below tables will not precisely align with the category 
values found in the reports themselves.  The below tables show a comparison of MSW disposal 
composition by weight for the six Great Lakes states.

At first glance, there are not any tell-tale differences between the Michigan characterization and 
others produced in the past decade, with the exception of Indiana, which appears to be an outlier 
due to the low percentage of organic material in its waste stream.  The scope of this study did not 
allow for a thorough review of recycling programs in other states.  However, the Illinois 
characterization did address recovery/recycling performance, estimating 37.8% diversion, which was 
believed to be a significant improvement for the state, though difficult to reliability quantify for lack 
of reliable baseline data.  In its SCORE program annual report, a separate document, Minnesota 
claims a 68% diversion rate. 

The composition differences between Michigan (15% recycling rate) and Illinois/Minnesota 
(38%/68%) are subtle, enough so that one might consider whether the state is performing as poorly 
as commonly believed.   Figure 3-2 shows the same data with the columns and rows reversed.   

Note the following: 

  Michigan has a higher percentage of paper material disposed than the high-performing 

states.  Paper is generally believed to be one of the more efficient materials to recycle, so it 
would be reasonable to assume that improvements would be most achievable in this 
category, and that high-performing state programs would have a lower percentage of this 
material than low-performing programs.  

  Michigan has a lower percentage of plastic than all of the Great Lakes states.  Plastic is 

generally believed to be more difficult to recycle, so it would be reasonable to assume that 
high-performing programs would have a higher percentage of material in this category, 
compared to lower percentages of materials less difficult to recycle.  

  Minnesota is the only Great Lakes state with a lower percentage of paper than plastic.  It is 

also the highest performing state, with a stated recycling rate of 68%.    

  Michigan has a lower percentage of organic material.  Organics are the most plentiful waste 

and not particularly easy to recycle, so it would be reasonable to assume that a high-
performing state would have a higher percentage of material in this category.

The 2013 Minnesota study benefitted from comparison with a 2000 statewide study.  The results 
were as predicted above:

In both cases, the percentage of paper decreased as the percentage of plastic and organics increased.  
There does exist the possibility that the changes in composition exhibited may also be due to 
industry developments unrelated to recycling performance.  This is demonstrated by the Ohio MSW 
disposal composition.  The oldest of the group, it contains by far the highest percentage of paper 
products.  The decline in paper use over the past 15 years is common knowledge.  

Regardless, the characteristics common to Illinois and Minnesota do appear to represent the ideal 
composition of MSW disposed for a high-recycling-performance state in the Great Lakes.  A high-
performing state has a lower percentage of paper products.  

The U.S. EPA MSW disposed composition estimate aligns with the Michigan and Great Lakes 
studies in most categories, with a stark difference for metal.  It is twice that of nearly every state 
report.  We do not have an explanation for why this would occur.       

All of the statewide studies followed similar methodologies from a sorting standpoint, but differed  
slightly by category definition and significantly in scope.  This study included more facilities than 
many of its peers, but the fewest total samples.  For instance, the Minnesota study sampled 30 
vehicles each from six facilities.  The Indiana study, of comparable scale to this project, sampled 20 
vehicles each from four facilities.  The Illinois study also characterized recovered/recycled MSW in 
its study, while Wisconsin sampled industrial and construction waste streams. 

For budgetary and logistical reasons, this study included fewer material categories than most of its 
peers.  It does not suffer in comparison, with one exception that will be discussed in Section 4.

4-1 MATERIAL VALUATION AND ECONOMIC IMPACT 

Changing the rate of recycling in Michigan would have many economic effects, including changes in 
recycling markets and municipal budgets.  Recycling rates also affect landfill capacity and real estate 
values and health outcomes for people living near landfills and incinerators. We consider each of 
these impacts below. 

Quantities 

In Table 4-1 we use the results of the MSW Characterization sorts that are discussed in detail in 
Section 2, and the two respective total MSW disposed estimates from the MDEQ Solid Waste 
Annual Report (Estimate 1) and Michigan Recycling Index (Estimate 2).

4-2 MATERIAL VALUE  

A primary benefit of increased recycling is the economic value found from reclaiming these 
resources and selling them to the market.  We have collected commodity prices for each of our 
composition categories and calculated the value of the material currently being disposed. 

Our process for defining material value is simple and straight-forward:  What will the market pay for 
a ton of the material in Michigan?    

The Kent County Department of Public Works (KC) provided data on the prices it received for 
bulk recyclables from June 2007 through April 2015. Given the categories used in the MSW 
characterization process, we use price data for PET plastic (#1), HDPE plastic (#2), mixed plastics 
(#3 through #7), plastic bags, mixed paper, newspaper, corrugated (cardboard), scrap/mixed metals, 
and glass. Aluminum sales by Kent County were infrequent and significantly below market prices, so 
we use aluminum price data provided by the Resource Recovery and Recycling Authority of 
Southwest Oakland County (RRRASOC). The prices per ton were computed by dividing their total 
revenues for each month by the total tons sold in that month. 

Representatives from Michigan recycling and processing firms confirmed the prices used were near 
competitive market rates for bulk recyclable materials. In particular, they confirmed Kent County’s 
prices received were in line with the rates they received for similar materials, and with national prices 
including those from reputable sources such as PPI Pulp and Paper Week's Official Board Markets (also 
called "The Yellow Sheet"), Iron Age, and the Scrap Price Bulletin. 

HDPE Plastic and Plastic Packaging 

As discussed in Section 3, in order to sort the minimum number of samples necessary with the labor 
budget available, this study limited its material categories to 20, later expanding it to 22.  These 
decisions were made before the price survey was fully complete, and it later became apparent that at 
least one additional material should have been sorted separately.   

Waste sort staff members combined #2 high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastics into the plastic 
packaging category, which included non-beverage containers and films and wrap from a variety of 
types of plastics.  The high-value of HDPE made this decision very meaningful in the valuation of 
MSW.  To reconcile this we estimated the proportion of each type of plastic in this sort category 
using recent estimates from the Indiana and Minnesota Characterization Studies.  The two states had 
about 8.47% of their MSW made of these materials, with 0.54% being PET plastic, 1.32% HDPE, 
and 6.62% of other types of plastics. The current study found 8.27% of Michigan MSW made of 
these materials, where the proportional amounts are about 0.52% PET plastic, 1.28% HDPE, and 
6.46% other. We estimate the value of materials in this category at the weighted average of these 
materials.

No Value for Electronics, EPS Foam and Organics 

Prices for electronics (including appliances and white goods), polystyrene (EPS foam), and 
organic/compostable and inorganic/non-compostable materials were all valued at zero based on 
historical data gathered from the representatives of relevant local companies.  

A local electronics recycler analyzed the complete list of electronics and appliances gathered by the 
waste characterization staff.  Some proportion of the materials was recyclable (such as power cords), 
but the materials had a sufficiently low market value that the recycler indicated it would not be 
profitable to process them.  While electronics such as computers, monitors, and printers have value 
for e-waste recyclers, little of this material was found in this study.  This result is consistent with the 
findings of other states, which will be discussed further in Section 5.   

Similarly, while polystyrene may have some value once densified, the value is low enough that we 
assume it to be zero.  WMSBF member companies that trade in recycled EPS foam confirmed this 
to be the case.   

A representative from a composting service also confirmed that there is a zero market value for 
unprocessed compostable materials. 

Deposit Containers 

Waste characterization staff sorted all Michigan deposit containers together. They estimated, post-
sort, that 40% of the weight was glass, 40% was aluminum, and 20% was PET plastic. We estimate 
the value of materials in this category at the weighted average of these materials. 

Textiles 

Textiles were also sorted by waste characterization staff. They estimated 80% of these materials were 
in good enough condition that they would donate them to a local non-profit. Increased donations to 
these non-profits add value to the local economy through clothing sales, sales tax receipts by local 
and state governments, employment opportunities, and support these non-profits provide through 
pursuit of their missions. While we do not have a good estimate of these values, we use $100 per 
ton, the price given by Trans-Americas Trading Company on its website.  

This price was validated by a representative from a local non-profit who processes donated textiles. 
Market prices for recyclable materials are notoriously volatile, and predicting their movements is 
difficult. We provide the interquartile range (the 25th and 75th percentiles) of the prices paid to 
Kent County for each material for the last year (May 2014 through April 2015). All prices and their 
sources are reported in Table 3 (note that "KC: weighted average" uses HDPE price quartiles of 
665.11 and 1074.745, based on data from RRRASOC).

We estimate the value of recyclables currently disposed of in Michigan landfills and incinerators by 
multiplying the mean of the two estimates of the available MSW, the percent of each type in the 
waste stream, and the price of a ton of each material. To account for the contamination of recycled 
materials and handling in the materials processing facilities we multiply this number by 0.9 for all 
materials except textiles. Textiles would presumably be collected as a separate stream, and so we 
multiply it by 0.8, the proportion of those materials waste characterization staff estimated was of 
donation-level quality.  

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An increase in recyclable materials would also increase the total amount of material available in the 
market. This increase in supply would likely push down the per-ton market price of these materials.  

We estimate the change in market price given a change in quantity using an “elasticity” estimate for 
this relationship defined by economist Karen Palmer and co. (Palmer, Sigman, and Wells,  1996.) We 
compute the change in quantity comparing the maximum possible increase in recyclable materials in 
Michigan against the national market size in 2013 (EPA 2015).  The market values of the available 
recyclables are provided in Table 4-3.

Thus, we estimate there is between $293 million and $368 million in available recyclable materials 
currently being disposed of in incinerators and landfills in Michigan.   

For comparison, the 2015 Illinois MSW characterization study estimated the value of that state’s 
landfilled materials at over $360 Million. 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
Implications 

First, we should note that the value of ferrous metals may be overstated by $7 million to $12 million.   
The ferrous metal reclaimed from incinerator ash in Grand Rapids and Detroit is by definition 
available to be reclaimed from MSW disposed through diversion efforts.  However, the diversion of 
this material from MSW disposed would not be a net-gain for recovered material in the state, as 
increases in diversion of this material would represent a corresponding decrease in its reclamation 
from incinerator ash.   

We have not made an adjustment to the available material value based on incinerator ash 
reclamation, or for that matter, other salvage or reclamation activities that may occur after materials 
arrive at a landfill, incinerator or transfer station that we may not be aware of.  We do take this into 
consideration as part of the economic impact projection. 

Also it should be noted that the material value of deposited containers is significantly less than the 
value of the deposits themselves.  This will be discussed further in Section 5.  

Finally, it should be highlighted that only half of the 22 categories analyzed in the characterization 
have any material value to the market.  These are presented in Figure 4-3 below. 

Due largely to the presence of HDPE plastic, plastic packaging would offer the most aggregate 
material value to the state.  This is followed by corrugated cardboard, ferrous metal, aluminum and 
textiles, then all other materials.  

50 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total material value is not the best method to evaluate opportunity for diversion improvements.  
For instance, aluminum represents 13.5% of the available material value with a high-price estimate 
of $50.2 million.  Yet it is only 0.43% of the aggregate statewide composition of MSW disposed.  
Figure 4-4 expresses these discrepancies below. 

Viewed in this way, we see that one material exemplifies a high-value, high-quantity scenario: 
corrugated cardboard.  Though not as prominent, plastic packaging does offer a similar opportunity, 
though it is likely overstated due to the comingling of HDPE in the category definition.  Ferrous 
metal and textiles also show good value for the quantity of material available. 

Mixed paper is unique in that it has the largest quantity of available material among any category 
with a market value.  Though it is the lowest value per ton of any of the valuable materials, its large 
quantity would suggest it is “low-hanging fruit” for diversion improvements.  

51 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
4-3 OPERATING COSTS 

To fully understand the potential economic impact of increased recycling we must also consider the 
cost savings inherent in diverting materials from the landfill or incinerator. Using our estimates of 
non-ash landfill and incinerator tonnage, the data show that about 15.69% of Michigan MSW is 
incinerated each year while the remaining 84.31% is landfilled. Each of these types of facilities has its 
own operating costs, and increased recycling would avoid these costs. 

Landfills 

Two approaches to valuing the financial costs of landfilling material are computing the marginal cost 
(adding tonnage to a currently operating facility) and computing the average cost of landfilling (the 
net present value of the average cost per ton added to a facility). People and companies dispose of 
MSW over time and across geography, so it is not possible to say any particular facility opened 
because of the failure to recycle materials. Regardless, this material fills facilities and causes the 
expansion of existing landfills and creation of new facilities over time. Given the ongoing cost of 
closing old facilities, opening new ones, and operating and expanding existing ones across the state, 
we use the average cost approach over computing the cost of adding additional tons to an existing 
landfill. 

The cost of landfill construction and maintenance differs considerably across site characteristics  (see 
Duffy 2015 and Eilrich, Doeksen, and VanFleet 2002).  We do not know the geography, regulatory 
environment, or features of future landfills, and so use multiple cost estimates. The literature 
provides multiple estimates of landfill construction costs. Scholarly research suggests an average 
price of $36.58 per ton over the lifetime of a landfill (adjusted from the 2002 value of $27.80 per ton 
to 2014 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index’s (CPI-U) inflation 
adjustment of 1.316).  Available literature also provides a thorough analysis of construction costs 
under different assumptions and estimates an average cost of $26.36 per ton.  

We do not use in our calculations a third available estimate of the cost of landfilling from a local 
facility. Over 2013 and 2014 Kent County spent $7,574,543 on landfilling MSW in the South Kent 
Landfill. During this time the South Kent Landfill processed 511,092 tons of MSW for an average 
cost of $14.82 per ton. These costs do not include initial bond or startup costs, the gas-to-energy 
plant, outreach and education, the household hazardous waste program, maintenance of any closed 
landfills, solid waste planning activities, or any legacy costs (preparing for closing and maintenance 
of the site). This value represents the cost of adding tons of MSW to an existing facility, which is 
substantially below the average cost we are trying to capture. Instead, we use the tipping fee 
currently set for the facility, which is intended to capture some of these other costs. The 2015 
tipping fee is $36.10 per ton, a fee which is intended to represent the total average cost of a ton of 
MSW to the county.

Thus, we have identified three estimates of the cost of a ton of MSW placed into a landfill, $36.58, 
$26.36, and $36.10, which average to $33.01 per ton. This estimate also omits the possible cost of an 
extreme outcome, such as when a closed landfill becomes a Superfund Cleanup site. 

Incinerators 

There are currently two waste incinerators operating in Michigan, the Waste-To-Energy facility in 
Kent County and the Greater Detroit Resource Recovery Facility. During 2013 and 2014 the MSW 
incineration facility in Kent County handled 371,803 tons of MSW at a total cost of $39,304,961. 

The facility produced 204,438 Mwh of electricty, worth approximately $50 per Mwh, for an 
estimated total revenue of about $10,221,900. This leaves a net cost of $29,083,061, or $78.22 per 
ton of MSW processed. As previously discussed, incineration also isolates ferrous metals which can 
be resold, which are omitted in this analysis because we need to compute the cost of incineration 
independent of the value of reclaimed recyclables, as increased recycling would remove those 
materials from the MSW stream before it arrived at the incinerator. This resulted in operating costs 
of about $78.22 per ton of MSW. We did not have access to any recent documentation of the 
operating costs and volumes of the other incinerator in Michigan for comparison purposes. 

Material Recovery Facilities  

The Material Recovery Facility in Kent County processed 62,538 tons of material at a cost of 
$6,260,514 (which includes bond payments) during 2013 and 2014 for gross average operating cost 
of approximately $100.11 per ton. This is a modern, single-stream facility that sorts out a wide 
variety of recyclable materials.  

While it may be possible for a multi-stream facility or a facility that extracts a narrow range of 
materials to sort recyclables at a lower cost, the movement seems to be toward single-stream 
processing. We do not net out the revenues from the recyclable materials, as those are computed 
separately from the per-ton processing cost in our analysis.

4-4 INDIRECT EFFECTS 

People differ in their willingness to value non-bugetary costs when valuing projects, and increasing 
recycling is no exception. In this section we examine a variety of other issues which may be of 
interest to policymakers and the public.  

Landfill Capacity 

Another benefit of increased recycling is that it would increase the lifespan of existing landfills. 
According to MDEQ Michigan has 495,809,471 cubic yards of remaining, approved landfill capacity 
as of the end of the 2013-2014 fiscal year.  If MSW is created at the same rate as during that year, 
Michigan currently has enough total capacity for about 26 more years.  Removing all recyclable 
materials of value would reduce MSW by nearly 40%, substantially extending the lifespan of existing, 
approved landfill capacity. Interviews with industry professionals indicated that some facilities have 
additional land available that has not been developed but could be added to their existing facilities. 

This issue is more complicated than simply extending the lifespan of total statewide landfill capacity. 
MSW is spread across landfills with between 1 year and 556 years of remaining capacity at current 
rates. While it has been many years since a new landfill has been opened in Michigan, facilities will 
be expanded, closed, and new ones opened over time. Reducing the MSW stream by diverting 
additional recyclables would increase the average across the state, but would reduce the need to 
expand existing facilities and open new facilities over time.

Real Estate Values 

A study analyzing housing prices near landfills showed that high volume landfills (500 tons per day 
or more) reduce adjacent housing values by 12.9% and that rate decreases 5.9% per mile, while 
lower volume landfills decrease adjacent housing values by 2.5% on average, decreasing at 1.2% per 
mile (Ready, 2005).  

Given the uncertain nature of future landfills, we take the average of these numbers: 7.7 for adjacent 
houses decreasing at 3.5% per mile. To simplify the analysis we assume the effect ends after two 
miles and that the effect radiates from a single point. We note that this set of assumptions biases the 
estimate of damages toward zero. 

Landfills are likely to be built in rural areas rather than urban areas. According to the US Census  
and the American Community Survey (2009-2013), Michigan has about 47.5 people per square mile 
in rural areas, an average house size of 2.1 people, and an average house price of $121,700. This 
results in about $2,752,738 in house values for every square mile of rural Michigan property (which 
includes small towns of with fewer than 10,000 people). 

A one-mile radius circle around a point contains 3.14 square miles of property (about $8,643,597 in 
value) while the second mile-wide ring around that contains an additional 9.43 square miles (about 
$25,958,319 in value). If we estimate the loss in value of homes in the first ring at the average of the 
adjacent value and the one mile ring (7.7 and 4.2%; 6%), and homes in the second mile ring at the 
average of those two values (4.2 and 0.7%; 2.5%) the total decrease in housing values would be 
about $518,616 and $648,958 for a total of $1,167,574.  

According to MDEQ solid waste reports, the median landfill in Michigan disposed of 459,660 cubic 
yards (153,220 tons) during 2013-2014. Assuming the construction of a single landfill of moderate 
size handling the additional MSW caused by non-recycling would result in a real estate loss of about 
$7.62 per ton of MSW processed.  

We estimate the benefit of increased recycling on real estate near an incinerator at zero, as the two 
incinerators in Michigan are likely to stay in business even if there is a reduction in waste volumes, 
and a decrease in volume will have little impact on the visual impact, odor, or psychological effects 
of living near the facility.  

When weighting the real estate loss of $7.62 per ton for landfills by the 84.31 percent of materials 
sent to landfills (as opposed to incineration) this adds an additional social cost of $6.50 per ton.

Environmental Effects: Greenhouse Gases 

The EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WaRM) calculates the outcomes of various waste management 
techniques in terms of their carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2E) across many common materials. 
The online WaRM calculator provided the net effect of landfilling or incineration of materials 
against recycling, with results listed in Table 4-4. We use the baseline assumptions from the 
calculator, including use of the national average for landfill-gas extraction (since landfills differ 
across the state) and travel distances of 20 miles.  

The table below computes the carbon dioxide improvement from recycling versus landfilling or 
incinerating for each type of material. We then weigh the improvements in tons of carbon dioxide 
by type of disposal, assuming 15.69% of materials are incinerated rather than landfilled, and multiply 
by the June 2015 auction price in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative of $5.50 per ton.

Environmental Effects and Health Effects 

Tables 4-5a and 4-5b contain a variety of estimates of the environmental and health impacts of 
MSW. These results vary widely by the pollutants included and the specific setting of the facility. We 
do not know the conditions of a particular new facility and so use the average of the high and low 
estimates from each study cited. Note that in each case some value has been given to carbon dioxide 
so they would not be added to the damage estimates from Table 4-4.

and $13.34 per ton of MSW in incinerators, weighted by the percent of MSW that is landfilled or 
recycled this yields an average environmental impact of $11.28. Given our goal of assessing total 
social cost we use Method 2, which accounts for the other energy sources displaced.

4-5 TOTAL IMPACT 

The impact of increasing recycling varies depending on the materials diverted from the MSW 
stream, where it is sent for processing, and what non-budgetary impacts are included. 

The budgetary costs of one ton of recyclables placed in the MSW stream for landfilling or recycling 
is: 

CostLandfill*ProportionMSWLandfill + CostIncinerate*ProportionMSWIncinerate 

Or 

$33.01/ton * 0.8531 + 78.22/ton * 0.1569 

This yields an average operating cost of disposing of MSW of $40.43 per ton of MSW.  

The real estate loss of $7.62 per ton for landfills (weighted by the 85.31% of materials sent to 
landfills) adds an additional social cost of $6.50 per ton, for a total processing cost of $46.93. Adding 
in environmental and health effects, weighted by the percent of materials sent to landfills versus 
incinerators yields an additional average cost of $11.28 per ton of MSW. Adding together the 
operations cost of landfills and incinerators, the impact on property values, and other environmental 
and health effects yields a total social cost of $58.21 per ton of MSW.  

With this approach one would not include the cost of carbon dioxide computed in Table 4-3 above, 
as that has already been incorporated in these estimates.  

While recycling materials saves on these costs, it must be processed. The total cost of sending the 
material to a MRF is the gross cost of processing ($100.11 per ton of MSW) net of the revenues 
from selling the recycled materials. Returning to the adjusted value per ton of recyclable, we see that 
it matters which types of recyclable materials are removed from the waste stream.  

Using the values computed above we can compare the cost of landfilling and incineration against the 
cost of recycling, such as from removing a ton PET plastic from the MSW stream into recycling. 
In the first approach this ton of materials avoids the cost of landfilling and incinerating the 
materials, the associated impact on real estate values, and the social values while capturing the 
revenues from resale of the material.  

This total benefit is measured aganst the cost of MRF sorting in table 4-5.  Here we see a per-ton 
metric for the net impact of recycling each type of material. For the case of PET plastic, diverting 
one ton of material out of the MSW stream into recycling yields a gain between $191.64 and $247.87 
in total social benefits per ton. For mixed paper the values range from a loss of $7.99 to a gain of 
$1.81 in total social benefits per ton.

4-6 EMPLOYMENT IMPACT 
Increasing recycling will create jobs in Michigan. The value of recyclable materials diverted from 
landfills and incinerators to markets will eventually end up with households through increased 
employment and profits by waste haulers and recycling processors, and also through purchases of 
goods and services to support these businesses. 

Since very little virgin material (particularly plastics and metals) is extracted in Michigan, we assume 
all of the revenues from the sale of recyclables can be counted as new household spending. Using 
RIMS multipliers for Kent County from 2006 (adjusting the jobs multiplier per million dollars by 
inflation since 2006), we find extracting recycling from the MSW stream would create between 2,085 
and 2,619 full time equivalent jobs in Michigan with a total effect of between $317 and $399 million 
dollars.

5-1 SUMMARY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 

In the preceding sections we have accomplished the primary objectives of this study, which was to 
provide information and analysis on the composition of municipal solid waste currently landfilled 
and incinerated in Michigan, and the economic value of this material.  Its findings are derived 
entirely from field studies, verifiable market prices for recycled commodities, and peer-reviewed 
academic studies. 

As detailed in Section 4, we estimate total material value of Michigan MSW disposed in landfills and 
incinerators of as much as $368 million.  If all of this material was recovered and sold to the market 
it would have an estimated total economic impact of up to $399 million.  

In Table 5-1 we have summarized our findings for material composition and valuation, as well as the 
net recycling value per ton after accounting for indirect benefits and processing costs.  Together this 
data quantifies characterization of Michigan MSW disposed in landfills and incinerators by aggregate 
commodity value and as a net impact for recyclers and recycling communities.

Ideally, efforts to promote recycling or composting improvements would prioritize those with the 
highest composition and net recycling value.    

While there is an environmental or social case for promoting recovery of all MSW materials, there is 
no economic value in recovering many materials.  For many products the cost of processing exceeds 
both the material value and indirect benefits of recycling or composting.  Economic impact would 
not be the motivation for increasing diversion of these materials. 

Further, we should highlight emphatically that the material values used in this report are volatile and 
prone to change.  At the time we conducted our research commodity prices were experiencing sharp 
declines.  The situation will hopefully improve over time.  

In the following pages we will highlight some final points and then make recommendations on 
potential responses to this study.  An additional regional characterization for West Michigan can 
then be found in Section 6.

5-2 ELECTRONIC WASTE 

One of the secondary objectives of this study was an evaluation of electronic waste in Michigan 
MSW disposed in landfills and incinerators.  This was a particular interest of certain WMSBF Waste 
Task Force members, and of relevance to legislative and regulatory discussions currently underway 
in Michigan. 

Electronic waste, or e-waste, is one of the most complex streams in MSW, as it is immensely diverse 
and contains both hazardous and valuable materials.  The EPA determined that in 2012 the United 
States created 3.4 million tons of e-waste.  It also estimated that only 29% of the e-waste generated 
in 2012 was recycled, leaving 71% to end up in landfills and incinerators.  The growth of the 
category makes this especially pertinent: 2014 was an all-time high for electronics sales revenue.   

We have defined e-waste as electronic items that are nearing or have reached the end of their usable 
life, and which have been discarded by a consumer or business.  Electronic items are any product 
requiring a power source, which may or may not include circuitry.  Examples include, but are not 
limited to, computers and computer accessories, televisions, hard copy devices, mobile units, and 
entertainment systems. 

It had been our expectation that we would encounter a certain composition of electronic material 
that would have significant relevance to current regulatory and legislative conversations.  We did not.

Electronic waste represents an estimated 2.5% of Michigan MSW disposed in landfills and 
incinerators.  We expected to find predominantly problem materials such as cathode-ray tube 
televisions and high-value consumer and office equipment such as computers, laptops and cell 
phones.  The material sampled was much more diverse, and much more mundane, ranging from 
small appliances to happy-meal toys.  A full account of materials can be found in Table 5-2. 

High-value products were encountered, but comingled with low-value products to such a degree that 
it made the category worthless in aggregate.  Problem materials were also encountered, and under 
the same circumstances.  Thus, based on our findings, there is no evidence to support that electronic 
waste represents a particularly valuable or hazardous factor in Michigan MSW characterization.  The 
composition findings are consistent with that of other states, as demonstrated in Table 5-3.

Though electronic waste of the sort most prominently discussed was not encountered in significant 
quantities during this project, it is nonetheless a priority concern, and electronic waste in general is a 
much larger percentage of the MSW composition in Michigan than in other Great Lakes states or 
nationally, as shown in Figure 5-1, so there is opportunity for improvement.

Hazardous Waste Concerns 

The primary concern for allowing electronic waste into landfills and incinerators is potential negative 
impacts from toxic and hazardous components.   

The most prominent issues regarding the hazardous components of e-waste include the lead in 
cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions and monitors, the metals on printed circuit boards, and mercury 
in screens, lamps and switches.  The tube or glass funnel in a CRT monitor uses a leaded glass and 
one tube can contain approximately 1 to 3 kg of lead.  Printed circuit boards, which are found in the 
majority of electronic items, use a lead and tin mix in their solder, cadmium and beryllium in 
contacts and occasionally have mercury in switches.  Mercury is also commonly found in fluorescent 
lamps of laptop screens and some batteries.  

The first attempts to quantify the hazardous impact of e-waste in the landfill were a series of 
experiments using the U.S. EPA Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP).  The TCLP is 
a laboratory experiment that is used to determine whether a solid waste is hazardous from the 
leaching of hazardous pollutants.  While household wastes are exempt from the categorization of 
hazardous waste, scientists were still interested in testing electronics using this method.   

In 1999 an academic study found that on average the leachable lead concentration for a CRT was 
18.5 mg/l, well above the 5 mg/l regulatory limit.  In 2004 the laboratory group did a similar study 
using the TCLP and a modified TCLP to test the leachable lead concentration in other electronics 
items including computers, computer accessories, VCRs, printers, and cell phones and found that all 
items surpassed the regulatory limit in at least one test. The researchers that used the TCLP admitted 
that they did not represent landfill conditions and since then others have attempted to determine the 
potential for hazardous leachate in environments closer to that of a landfill, with mixed results.  

Whether or not e-waste will significantly impact landfill leachate, it is still necessary to begin to 
quantify the amount of hazardous material being deposited in landfills and incinerators via e-waste.   
For our study, we had intended to quantify the hazardous impact laptop screens and CRT monitors 
using information from Table 5-3. These materials were not found in large enough quantities to 
make any calculations meaningful.

E-Waste Material Value 

The secondary concern for allowing electronic materials into landfills is the loss of the resources and 
corresponding potential for economic gain.  Although our study suggested that the material 
encountered had little economic value, more promising estimates do exist. The Institute of Scrap 
Recycling Industry estimates that electronics recycling has contributed $20.6 billion to the US 
economy and employs more than 45,000 full-time employees.   

Currently, there are 26 electronics recycling companies that are registered with the MDEQ. 
Businesses and consumers bring electronics to local recycling facilities that disassemble them into 
commodities which can be sold.  Some materials are sold to be directly recycled like scrap ferrous 
metal, scrap plastic, and certain kinds of glass.  

Other commodities such as whole laptops, power supplies, circuit and motherboards, batteries, 
RAM, processors, disk drive, and hard drives are more valuable when sold intact to companies that 
can either reuse them or specialize in the recycling of that commodity.   

In some cases, usable or refurbished electronics, particularly computers, are shipped overseas in 
order to provide access to digital resources to people in developing nations who could not afford 
new products.  Computers and computer parts are the most valuable commodities for electronics 
recyclers.  Table 5-6 describe the composition of three common types of electronics and Table 5-7 
shows a range of prices for those commodities.  

This material did not appear in significant enough quantities to track.

Landfill Ban Context 

In 2008 the State of Michigan enacted an addition to the Natural Resources and Environmental 
Protection Act of 1994 that outlined requirements for television and computer manufacturers to 
support recycling efforts for their products. The law took effect in 2010, making Michigan one of 23 
states which have passed consumer responsibility laws that address the recycling of televisions, 
computers, or other electronic items. 

Computer and television manufacturers have slightly different requirements: Computer 
manufacturers only need take back computers that they manufactured, while television 
manufacturers must take back any brand of television.  Television manufacturers also have a non-
binding target to collect 60% of the number of televisions sold the previous year.  Both are 
permitted to collaborate in groups or to contract a third party to meet the take-back requirements 
In 2014, 78 television and computer manufacturing companies registered with the Michigan MDEQ.  
Manufacturers reported collecting 12,920 tons of material, while the Michigan Recycling Index 
estimated 24,000 tons in total were recycled.   

Recently, many manufacturers have reduced funding for these programs in Michigan, forcing 
collectors and recyclers of CRT televisions and computer monitors, who had previously received 
subsidies from the manufacturers, to either stop collecting the material or require customers to pay a 
fee to have their CRT recycled.  There was an expectation that this study would encounter a 
significant number of CRT televisions.  These were found, but it did not represent a noteworthy 
portion of e-waste or MSW. 

To help address this issue and related concerns, there is discussion of a landfill ban for some types 
of e-waste in Michigan.  Some 12 states currently have bans on the incineration or landfill of certain 
electronic items.  In Michigan, the only items related to electronics that are currently banned from 
landfills and incineration facilities are appliances containing refrigerants and lead acid batteries.   

Illinois addressed electronic waste concerns with a landfill ban of certain materials in 2011, similar to 
regulations currently under consideration in Michigan.  The impact of that legislation can be 
measured through the 2009 and 2015 MSW characterization studies.  Though the overall amount of 
electronic waste is consistent between the two years, there are subtle differences in the material 
categories targeted by the law.

5-3 DEPOSIT CONTAINERS 

In total, 522 deposit containers were encountered during the waste sorts. The total weight of this 
material was 56.28 pounds.  The total weight of sorted samples was 20,634 pounds.  From this we 
can calculate the deposit value of these unredeemed containers via two potential methods, one using 
the quantity of cans sampled per ton, and one using composition by weight.

The two methods produce similar results in a range of $44.8 million to $45.6 million.  According to 
the Michigan Department of Treasury, in 2013, the latest year for which data was available at the 
time of this study, Michigan retailers collected $368.3 million in bottle deposits.  Some 94.5% of 
those deposits were redeemed, leaving approximately $21.5 million unredeemed.  

Allowing for variance between 2013 deposit data and 2015 MSW data, and keeping in mind that our 
study was not designed to test recovery rates of deposited containers or the effectiveness of the 
bottle deposit law, our findings suggest an inconsistency between the amount of deposited 
containers being disposed of in Michigan landfills and incinerators, and the amount that should be 
available for disposal.  Our findings suggest that there is more than double the number of deposited 
beverage containers in Michigan MSW than what deposit statistics suggest there should be.  

This could possibly be explained by differences between 2013 and 2015 expectations, as 2013 
represented a 20-year low for both deposits collected and redeemed, though unredeemed deposits 
that year were the highest since 2000.  Further research is merited.  

Regardless of explanation, deposit containers are meaningless to the composition of MSW disposed 
(0.29%), but somewhat meaningful to the total value of available material ($15 million), albeit less 
than the value of the unredeemed deposits.  

Despite the unexpected number, deposit containers were still a de minimis, or insignificant, quantity 
at all sites.

5-4 EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE FOAM 

A secondary impact of the project was to estimate the potential impact on the waste stream of 
replacing expanded polystyrene foam packaging with compostable alternatives derived from organic 
material. 

Though EPS foam, commonly associated with the Styrofoam brand, is a key concern for 
sustainability-minded consumers and businesses, it was not a significant percentage of MSW 
composition by weight, less than 1%.  

As an unscientific measure of volume we calculated the number of bins of material sorted 
throughout the project, as shown in Table 5-10.  While EPS did represent a larger percentage of 
bins, it was very near the minimum number of bins that would be found for materials that occurred 
in all samples sorted.  EPS is not a significant factor in the MSW waste stream. 

EPS was also not a factor in the material value of MSW disposed.  Interviews with WMSBF Task 
Force members that process EPS foam indicated that it was done strictly as a value-added service 
for customers.  Densified foam was reported to have some value, but ultimately the material is not 
profitable to recycle under current conditions, and it is extremely difficult to locate recyclers 
interested in processing the material.  As such, EPS is the only category that we have defined as not 
recyclable or compostable in our findings apart from the Other Inorganics category created 
specifically for materials that could not be recycled, composted or otherwise diverted.  

Compostable packaging is represented in the Other Organic category during the waste sorts.  We did 
not track the quantity of this material specifically, but empirical observations suggest it would be a 
very small quantity in context of aggregate MSW by weight or volume. 

EPS foam may have much greater relevance to the waste streams of individual consumers and 
businesses, and there are certainly sound environmental reasons for reducing its use in favor in 
practice or in favor of alternatives.  It has little relevance in the context of aggregate statewide MSW 
composition.

5-5 ILLINOIS RECYCLING RATE IMPROVEMENTS 

Before discussing recommendations for improving MSW recovery rates in Michigan, we conclude 
our findings with two graphs appropriated from the 2015 Illinois MSW characterization study 
detailing changes in recovery rates between 2008 and 2014.   A thorough examination of recycling 
programs in other states was not an objective of this study, so we do not have a great deal of insight 
into what is presented in Table 5-6 and Figures 5-3 and 5-4 below.   

We can highlight that from 2008 to 2014 Illinois increased its statewide recycling rate from 19.1% to 
37.3% through the activities and improvements detailed below, which includes some notable 
differences and surprising similarities to Michigan.  The report did indicate that changes in data 
collection may account for some of the improvements, especially for Construction and Demolition 
Waste, but it serves as a meaningful baseline nonetheless.

Illinois demonstrated no marked improvement in recycling of plastic in general, and its 
current plastic recycling rate is identical to that of Michigan. It did demonstrate an enormous 
increase in HDPE, the highest value plastic commodity, represented within the plastic 
packaging category in our study.  
Illinois improved paper in general, and corrugated cardboard and boxboard specifically.  Its 
paper recycling rate is more than twice that of Michigan.  It increased its corrugated 
cardboard recycling rate to over 50% recovery. 
Illinois increased its textile recycling rate to nearly 20%. Michigan recovers just 9% of its 
textiles. 
Illinois increased is metal recycling rate dramatically to more than 50%.  Michigan recovers 
35% of its metal from MSW.

RECOMMENDATIONS 

Efforts to increase the recycling rate in Michigan should first focus on the 42% of materials that 
have market value, which would include all standard recyclable commodities but glass, plus textiles. 

We argue that doubling the recycling rate itself is an arbitrary goal, albeit a worthwhile motivational 
tool.  A potentially better metric would be the percentage of material of value in the waste stream, 
with a goal of reducing this to zero.   

Keeping to the stated goal of doubling the Michigan recycling rate to 30%, our findings do provide a 
rough outline for how that might be best achieved.  In total, the state must increase the quantity of 
diverted material by approximately 1.5 million tons per year through a combination of recovery and 
source reduction.      

1.  Aggressively promote efforts to increase recovery of corrugated cardboard, prioritizing 
commercial audiences.  This is an ideal opportunity and should be considered “low-hanging 
fruit.”  Corrugated cardboard is among the state’s highest volume materials.  It is perhaps the 
easiest material to recycle, and boasts a net recycling value of $55 per ton, the highest return 
among high-volume material. The market for the material is well-developed and not likely to 
experience any significant technological or market upheavals in the foreseeable future.   

2.  Support efforts to increase availability and usage of conventional recycling programs 

with a goal to increase recovery of non-corrugated paper products, metal, and high-value 
plastic resins HDPE and PET.  As demonstrated in the economic analysis section, there are a 
limited number of recyclable commodities that can be recycled without subsidy, and fewer still in 
high demand.  Efforts to increase recycling in Michigan should prioritize diverting materials of 
value from the waste stream.    

3.  Through recovery or source reduction, decrease the quantity of electronic waste 

disposed of in Michigan landfills by half.  As a percentage of MSW, Michigan disposes twice 
the amount of electronic waste as any of its neighboring states.  This would represent a dramatic 
improvement, considering that the state currently recycles just 9% of electronic waste.  A landfill 
ban could potentially achieve this.   

4.  Promote source reduction and diversion of food waste.  Food waste is the most prevalent 
material found in Michigan MSW.  It is a prime candidate for source reduction, which could be 
achieved through commercial efficiencies or consumer behavior change.  As an alternative, 
feeding the hungry is a universally positive diversion opportunity.  Composting, agriculture and 
renewable energy also offer diversion opportunities for consideration.    

5.  Promote source reduction of low-value plastic resins.  Michigan recycles 5% of plastic 

volumes currently, and it seems likely that the highest concentration of that is occurring with 
high-value, easy-to-recycle materials such as PET and HDPE.  Low-value resins are notoriously 
difficult to recycle due to logistical and financial challenges, which limits the potential 

77 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effectiveness of efforts to improve recycling of those commodities.  From a quantity standpoint, 
if the state were to quadruple its plastic recycling performance it would only increase the state’s 
recycling rate by a few percentage points.   

Strategies intended to promote packaging efficiency, reusable products and other source 
reduction tactics could have a more noticeable impact on Michigan’s MSW characterization and 
recycling rate.   

As an alternative, the state might pursue game-changing market development activities. 

6.  Initiate efforts to increase recycling channels for textiles and promote availability of 

textile recycling.  Though a minor impact in terms of aggregate recycling rate, this would have 
a significant impact on the total value of materials recovered.  This opportunity deserves greater 
attention than what it is currently receiving.  There is also clear potential for improvement:  
Michigan’s textile recycling rate (9%) is half that of Illinois (20%). 

7.  Educate the public on the financial difficulties of recycling and waste diversion.  The 
majority of MSW disposed in Michigan landfills and incinerators has no market value as an 
unprocessed commodity.       

8.  Pursue opportunities for further study highlighted in this report. 

  Performance of yard waste ban in context of high-concentration of non-banned 

materials that would be classified as yard waste.  

  Recovery rate of deposited containers in context of discrepancies suggested in this report 

between the number of deposited containers being disposed and recovered.  

  Repeat characterization study within three to five years. The results reported in this study 
represent a baseline, the state’s first derived from field study and verifiable commodity 
prices.  A repeat study will allow for the visualization of improvements over time, both 
in recycling performance and in economic conditions.  That is when the full value of this 
activity will be realized, and a timely opportunity given groundswell of efforts to increase 
recycling in Michigan in the near future.

6-1 WEST MICHIGAN CHARACTERIZATION REPORT 

Though a statewide resource, this project was driven by West Michigan stakeholders, and focused a 
disproportionate amount of its efforts on the seven-county West Michigan Prosperity Region.  The 
following pages highlight regional composition and valuation findings.   

West Michigan Municipal Solid Waste 

The seven-county region generated 1,046,013 tons of municipal solid waste in 2014, which was 
disposed of between 18 different facilities throughout Michigan.  Approximately 97% of that was 
processed locally.   

The region is a net importer of MSW from other parts of the state, but as that material would not 
likely be available to local recyclers and composters, it is not relevant to this study.  However, in this 
section there is a distinction between MSW disposed and generated.  We reason that only MSW 
generated locally can be recycled or composted locally. 

The quantity of West Michigan MSW is described in Figure and Table 6-1.   

Our study included sites in four counties: Kent, Muskegon, Ottawa, and Montcalm.  Sites sampled 
in Kent County represented 93% of MSW generated in the county, and 86% in Muskegon County.  
This allowed us to quantify the composition separately for the two counties.  The other five counties 
are represented in the West Michigan characterization.

Estimated waste composition for Muskegon and Kent Counties, and the West Michigan Regional 
Prosperity District, are in Table 6-2. 

We sampled 54 vehicles from West Michigan, 14 vehicles from Muskegon County and 27 from 
Kent County.  

A Muskegon County Landfill vehicle was omitted from the county calculations as it identified itself 
as originating from Cutlerville in Kent County.  Given that the Muskegon County Landfill did not 
receive any MSW from Kent in 2014, this did not seem likely to be accurate.  Presumably the vehicle 
actually originated in Coopersville or a like-sounding community.  The data is included in the West 
Michigan calculations, as we are confident it originated in West Michigan.  

An earlier version of this data was calculated using a methodology that weighted the landfill 
compositions against the amount of waste they receive from each community.  This seemed to best 
follow the methodology used to calculate the state MSW.  However, when examining outliers for 
each of the local compositions, it became apparent that they were being skewed by site-specific 
outliers that were not representative of the vehicles that had originated in the local communities.    

Using the same methodology as described in Section 4, we also have estimated the value of MSW 
generated in West Michigan that is currently being disposed in landfills and incinerators. 

Further, to identify notable variances between Kent and Muskegon county variances and the rest of 
the state, we calculated variance and Z Scores for each material.  Material categories with a Z score 
greater than +/- 0.5 were flagged.

6-2 KENT COUNTY CHARACTERIZATION   

Kent County generated 586,105 tons of MSW that was disposed of in landfills and incinerators in 
2014, split between seven sites in the West Michigan area.  The vast majority of that is disposed of at 
the South Kent landfill in Byron Center and the Kent County Waste to Energy Facility in Grand 
Rapids.  We sampled 27 vehicles from Kent County.

6-3 MUSKEGON COUNTY COMPOSITION 

Muskegon County generated 133,101 tons of MSW that was disposed of in landfills in 2014, split 
between three sites in the West Michigan area.  Some 61% of MSW is processed outside of the 
county at private sector landfills in Ottawa County.  The balance is processed at the Muskegon 
County Landfill in Ravenna.  We sampled 14 vehicles from Muskegon.

Four material categories stand out as statistically unique in Muskegon County’s MSW composition 
according to the Z score test described in the local composition methodology.  There is no obvious 
commonality between the materials to suggest why these outliers are unique to Muskegon.

We have not focused on site-specific findings thus far in this report, but given that there is a local 
interest in the composition of the Muskegon County landfill, a brief discussion seems prudent.  

Of the 10 vehicles sampled, eight indicated they were from communities in Muskegon County, one 
contained a load mixed with material from Ottawa and Muskegon counties, and one was recorded as 
originating in Kent County.  The Kent vehicle was omitted from the Muskegon and Kent 
calculations as this appeared to be an error. The facility received no waste from Kent in 2014.  That 
vehicle was also the most noteworthy outlier of the entire project: 73% of the sample was soil.

Using the Z score methodology (<0.5+/-), six material categories were flagged as statistically unique, 
a larger number of outliers than at any other site.  This may be partially due to sampling error, as this 
was the first facility sorted, and several protocol changes were made throughout the course of the 
first day of sorting.  

The soil outlier can be explained by the unusual sample containing 73% soil.  The electronics outlier 
can also be explained by an unusual load, with one sample containing 39% electronic material.

Scope 
This Protocol describes procedures for measuring the composition of unprocessed MSW by employing 
manual sorting for the WMSBF Project, funded by the MDEQ through the Pollution Prevention 
Grant Program (P2). This protocol includes procedures for the collection of a representative sorting 
sample1 of unprocessed waste, manual sorting of the waste into individual waste components, and data 
reduction. This method will be applied at seven select landfill sites, as determined by WMSBF. 

This protocol does not address all of the safety considerations or issues associated with its use. A project 
Health & Safety Plan has been developed for the appropriate safety and health practices. 

Apparatus 
Containers: 

Scale: 

Metal, plastic, or fiber sufficient for storing and weighing each waste component. 
Containers will be labeled according to the Sort Classifications described in Table 1. 
For components with a substantial moisture content (e.g., food waste), metal or 
plastic containers are recommended to avoid absorption of moisture by the 
container and subsequently the need for multiple weight measurements to 
maintain an accurate tare weight for the container.  
Mechanical or electronic scale, with a capacity of at least 200 lb (91 kg) and a 
precision of at least 0.1 lb (0.045 kg). 

Other Equipment:  Heavy-duty tarps, shovels, rakes, push brooms, dust pans, hand brooms, magnets, 

sorting table, first aid kit, miscellaneous small tools, traffic cones, traffic vests, 
leather or puncture-resistant gloves, hardhats, safety glasses, and leather/steel-toed 
boots (minimum 6”).

Hazards 
Review the hazards and procedures with operating and sorting personnel prior to conducting 
field activities.  

Sharp objects (i.e., nails, razor blades, hypodermic needles, and pieces of glass) can be present in solid 
waste. Personnel should be instructed of this danger, and they should use a brush to move waste 
particles aside while sorting rather than projecting their hands with force into the mixture. Personnel 
handling and sorting solid waste should wear appropriate protection, such as heavy leather gloves, dust 
masks, hardhats, safety glasses, and safety boots. 

During the unloading of waste from collection vehicles and its handling with heavy equipment, 
projectiles may issue from the mass of waste. The projectiles can include flying glass particles from 
breaking glass containers and metal lids from plastic or metal containers that burst under pressure when 
run over by heavy equipment. The problem is particularly severe when the waste handling surface is of 
high compressive strength, for example, concrete. Personnel should be informed of this danger, remain 
at an appropriate distance during the unloading process, and wear eye and head protection when in the 
vicinity of the collection vehicle unloading point and/or heavy equipment. Additionally, sorting 
personnel must remain vigilant and aware of vehicle traffic and vehicle movement around the facility. 

Select a location for the discharge of designated loads, manual sorting activities, and weighing 
operations which is flat, level, has adequate ventilation, and is away from the normal waste handling 
and processing areas. 

Containers of liquids, or other potentially dangerous wastes, shall be put aside and handled by facility 
personnel only.  

Calibration 
All weigh scale equipment shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Take 
appropriate corrective action if the readings are more than 5% different from those of the 
calibration weights. 

Weigh storage containers each day, or more frequently, if necessary, to maintain an accounting of the 
tare weight. 

Loss of mass from the sorting sample can occur through the evaporation of water. Therefore, samples 
should be sorted as soon as possible after collection. 

Procedure for Determining the Number of Samples 
200 to 300 lb (91 to 136 kg) of unprocessed solid waste will be used for sorting samples, when possible. 
The number of sorting samples for each sample site will be pre-determined by FTCH using the 
methodology described in this section. One sorting sample is chosen per vehicle load.  

Number of Vehicles per Day 
For a sampling period of k days2, the number of vehicles sampled each day shall be approximately n/k, 
where n is the total number of vehicle loads to be selected for the determination of waste composition.  

2   At this time, the number of samples days for each facility is assumed to be two or three. This value may change 

based upon the historical data requested from each facility.

Number of 200 to 300-lb (91 to 136-kg) Samples 
The number of sorting samples) (n) required to achieve a desired level of measurement precision is a 
function of the component(s) under consideration and the confidence level. The governing equation for 
n is as follows: 

where: 

t*  = 
= 
s 
e 
= 
    = 

Student t statistic corresponding to the desired level of confidence 
estimated standard deviation 
desired level of precision 
estimated mean 

Suggested values of s and    for waste components are listed in Table 2. Values of Student t* are given in 
Table 3 for 90% confidence level, which is the selected confidence level for this study. 

Estimate the number of samples (nʹ) for the selected conditions –that is, precision (e) and level of 
confidence (90%). For the purposes of estimation, select from Table 3 the t* value for n = ∞ for the 90% 
level of confidence. As the required number of samples will vary among the components for a given set 
of conditions, a compromise will be required in terms of selecting a sample size – that is, the number of 
samples that will be sorted. The component that is chosen to govern the precision of the composition 
measurement (and therefore the number of samples required for sorting) is termed the “governing 
component” for the purposes of this method3. 

After determining the governing component and its corresponding number of samples (no), return to 
Table 3 and select the student t statistic (t*o) corresponding to no. Recalculate the number of samples 
(that is n') using t*o.  

Compare no to the new estimate of n (that is n'), which was calculated for the governing component. If 
the values differ by more than 10 %, repeat the calculations. 

If the values are within 10 %, select the larger value as the number of samples to be sorted. Refer to 
ASTM D5231-92 (2008) - Standard Test Method for Determination of the Composition of Unprocessed 
Municipal Solid Waste for a sample calculation of n.  

Component Composition 
The component composition of solid waste is reported on the basis of the mass fraction (expressed as a 
decimal) – or percent of waste component i – in the solid waste mixture. The reporting is on the basis of 
wet weight - that is the weight of materials immediately after sorting.  

3   WMSBF has selected the “governing component” of newsprint paper to guide the calculation process.

Procedure for Waste Sorting 
There will be no sorting during precipitation events.  

The facility will identify a secure, flat and level area for discharge of the vehicle load. Pursuant to the 
MDEQ guidance for this project, the area must be paved or within the solid waste boundary. The surface 
should be swept clean or covered with a clean, durable tarp prior to discharge of the load.  

Position the scale on a clean, flat, level surface and adjust the level of the scale if necessary. Determine 
the accuracy and operation of the scale with a known (e.g., reference) weight. 

Weigh all empty storage containers and record the tare weights. 

Vehicles for sampling shall be selected at random during each day of the sampling event until the 
predetermined number of vehicles is reached for the particular landfill. The vehicles will be selected 
using a random list generator based on the expected average number of vehicles for the particular 
landfill.  

The selected truck must be weighed upon arrival to the facility to determine the general size of the 
municipal solid waste load. Since the goal is to use 200 to 300 lb from each selected truck, it is 
imperative to know the weight of the full load. For instance, if the load is only 1,000 lb, then once 
discharged and quartered, a single quarter of the material will be sufficient for the sample sort; if the 
load is 3,000 lb, then once the material is quartered, only a third of the quarter-load will be used for the 
sample sort.  

Direct the designated vehicle containing the load of waste to the area secured for discharge of the load 
and collection of the sorting sample. 

Direct the vehicle operator to discharge the load onto the clean surface in one contiguous pile, that is, to 
avoid gaps in the discharged load and to facilitate collection of the samples. Collect any required 
information from the vehicle operator before the vehicle leaves the discharge area. 

The material must be handled in a way that controls runoff. If the load has an appreciable amount of 
leachate, the team should forgo that particular truck and take the next truck.  

Using a front-end loader with at least a 1 cubic yard (0.765 cubic meter) bucket, remove the material 
longitudinally along one entire side of the discharged load in order to obtain a representative cross-
section of the material. The material shall be sufficient to form a mass of material which, on a visual 
basis, is at least four times the desired weight of the sorting sample (that is, approximately 1,000 lb [454 
kg]). Mix, cone, and quarter the material; then select one quarter of the total amount to be the sorting 
sample, using a random method of selection6 for the purpose of eliminating or minimizing biasing of the 
sample. If an oversize item (for example, water heater) composes a large weight percent of the sorting 
sample, add a notation on the data sheet and weigh it, if possible. Unprocessed solid waste is a 
heterogeneous mixture of materials; therefore, care must be taken during application of the random 
procedure for sample collection, ensuring a representative sample.  

One sorting sample is selected from each collection vehicle load designated for sampling. All handling 
and manipulation of the discharged load and longitudinal and sorting samples shall be conducted on 
previously cleaned, flat, level surface. If necessary, remove the sorting sample to a secured manual 
sorting area. For convenience of the sorting personnel, the sorting sample may be placed on a clean 
table for sorting. A comprehensive list of waste components for sorting is presented in Table 1. A 

6  The random method of selection will conducted simply using two coins and assigning a quadrant to each 

combination (i.e., two heads = Q1; head1/tails2 = Q2; etc).

description of the waste component categories is given in Appendix 1. Label the storage containers 
accordingly.  

Position the storage containers around the sorting sample. Empty all containers, in the sorting sample, 
of their contents (i.e., capped jars and paper or plastic bags.) Segregate each waste item and place it in 
the appropriate storage container. 

In the case of composite items found in the waste, separate the individual materials where practical, 
and place the individual materials into the appropriate storage containers. Where impractical, segregate 
the composite items for classification by the crew chief according to the following procedure: 

 

 

 

 

If there are many identical composite items place those into the waste component containers 
corresponding to the materials present in the item, and in the approximate proportions according to 
the estimated mass fraction of each material in the item. EXAMPLE: Place plastic-sheathed 
aluminum electrical conductors in the designated container. 

If there are only a few of the identical composite item, place them in the storage container 
corresponding to the material that comprises, on a weight basis, the majority of the item. EXAMPLE: 
Place bi-metal beverage cans in the ferrous container. 

If composite items represent substantial weight percents of the sorting sample, a separate category 
should be established. EXAMPLE: Composite roofing shingles.  

If none of the situations above is appropriate, place the item(s) (or proportion it/them) in the 
storage container labeled Other Non-Combustible or Other Combustible, as appropriate. 

Sorting continues until the maximum particle size of the remaining waste particles is approximately 
0.5 inch (12.7 mm). At this point, apportion the remaining particles into the storage containers 
corresponding to the waste components represented in the remaining mixture. The apportionment shall 
be accomplished by making a visual estimate of the mass fraction of waste components represented in 
the remaining mixture. 

Record the gross weights of the storage containers and of any waste items sorted, but not stored in 
containers. A data sheet, such as the example in the Reporting section of this Protocol, will require the 
user to record both gross and tare weights. 

After recording the gross weights, empty the storage containers and weigh them again, if appropriate. 
Re-weighing is important and necessary if the containers become moisture-laden, i.e., from wet waste.  

Prohibited wastes (e.g., returnable beverage containers; household hazardous wastes; etc.) must be 
segregated out after sampling and properly handled by the facility team. 

Clean the sorting site and the load discharge area of all waste materials.
