INTRODUCTION 

Introduction 

The  1990  Georgia  Comprehensive  Solid  Waste  Management  Act  codified  improved 
methods  of  solid  waste  management  in  the  State.    A  section  of  the  Solid  Waste 
Management  Act  set  forth  a  25  percent  statewide  per  capita  municipal  solid  waste 
disposal reduction goal by July 1996.  Although the State’s per capita municipal solid 
waste  disposal  rate  climbed  from  5.56  pounds  per  person  per  day  in  1993  to  7.14 
pounds per person per day in 2003, many of Georgia’s municipalities have made great 
strides  in  reducing  the  waste  stream  by  promoting  waste  reduction,  reuse,  and 
recycling.    Despite  increased  recycling  and  waste  reduction  program  efforts  in  the 
90’s, Georgia has seen an annual increase, in aggregate and per capita, in the amount 
of waste sent to landfills in the past decade.  

Information  provided  by  the  Georgia  Department  of  Community  Affairs  (“DCA”) 
indicates that, as of 2003, the state had 25.6 years of remaining permitted municipal 
solid waste disposal capacity.1   

Waste  composition  data  plays  a  critical  role  in  solid  waste  system  planning  and 
design.    Data  generated  from  waste  composition  studies  are  used  in  several  ways, 
including  determining  the  quantity  of  material  available  for  recovery,  measuring  the 
effectiveness  of  existing  recycling  programs,  and  right-sizing  solid  waste  and 
recycling facilities. 

Due to the importance of waste composition data in solid waste system planning and 
design, the Georgia DCA urges counties to use locally-developed waste composition 
data  in  preparing  their  respective  solid  waste  master  plans  that  are  filed  periodically 
with the State.  Due to the cost and level of resources associated with conducting these 
studies,  many  counties  opt  to  use  alternative  sources  of  data  to  estimate  the 
composition  of  their  waste  stream.    Alternative  data—such  as  national  waste 
generation estimates, or studies based on other states or regions of the country—may 
not accurately represent the local waste stream characteristics in Georgia. 

DCA  recognized  the  need  to  provide  more  accurate  waste  characterization  data  that 
would  add  to  the  validity  of  municipal  solid  waste  management  plans  and  make  it 
easier  for  local  governments  to  plan  for  and  anticipate  the  full  costs  of  their  waste 
management  programs.    From  a  solid  waste  planning  perspective,  the  State  would 
benefit greatly from more comprehensive solid waste disposal data.  DCA retained the 

1 2004 Solid Waste Management Annual Report, Georgia Department of Community Affairs Office of 
Environmental Management. Annual Reports can be found online at the Georgia Department of 
Community Affairs’ website at http://www.dca.state.ga.us/development/research/programs/swar.asp.

consulting firm of R.W. Beck, Inc. to perform a multi-phase, statewide municipal solid 
waste  (“MSW”)  characterization  study  (“the  Project”)  to  better  understand  the 
composition of solid waste being disposed in Georgia. 

Project Objectives 

The purpose of the Project was to prepare information that can be used by cities and 
counties across Georgia to estimate the composition of their disposed municipal solid 
waste streams based on the results of a set of representative waste composition studies 
performed across the state. Waste generated outside the state of Georgia was excluded 
from the Study. 

Specific objectives of the Study were to: 

(cid:132)  Determine the composition of Georgia’s overall waste stream; 

(cid:132)  Determine  the  waste  composition  by  Georgia  Regional  Development  Center 

(“RDC”);  

(cid:132)  Compare the composition of waste for each of the material categories determined 

by DCA for each RDC and the State as a whole; 

(cid:132)  Provide local governments with locally-developed waste composition data needed 

to prepare solid waste master plans; and 

(cid:132)  Prepare a web-based, interactive computer model for Georgia’s local governments’ 

use in estimating the composition of their disposed waste stream. 

These  objectives  were  met  by  this  Study  and  the  data  herein  can  be  used  by  solid 
waste planners in each of the State’s 159 counties and 528 municipalities. The study 
also  provides  a  baseline,  which  has  not  previously  been  established,  from  which  the 
State can redefine the reduction goals set forth in the 1990 Solid Waste Management 
Act.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  statewide  aggregate  waste  stream  composition  data 
that was developed in this study has a higher level of statistical confidence than RDC-
level or generating sector composition profiles. Local estimates that are produced from 
this  study's  data,  while  not  as  precise  as  the  statewide  estimates,  are  however  a  vast 
improvement over current methods of estimating local waste composition.   

Solid waste planners can use the results of this Study to better anticipate the amount of 
municipal  solid  waste  disposed  in  their  community/region,  document  anticipated 
tonnages,  and  plan  for  the  design  or  retrofit  of  facilities  needed  to  process  the  solid 
waste stream.  Each of these outcomes is beneficial as the State seeks to emphasize the 
importance  of  the  role  of  solid  waste  management  planning  and  how  it  relates  to 
determining  the  quantity  of  material  available  for  recovery  through  municipal 
the  effectiveness  of  existing  recycling  programs,  and 
programs,  measuring 
determining future needs for solid waste and recycling facility siting.

Waste Disposal Overview 

Regional Development Center and Statewide Waste Disposal 

Information from Quarterly Disposal Reports from the State’s Landfills 

The purpose of the field sampling and sorting that was performed for this project was 
to  definitively  characterize  the  composition  of  disposed1  municipal  solid  waste 
(“MSW”)2.   Accordingly,  R.W.  Beck  evaluated  other  sources  of  disposal  data  to  be 
factored into the overall analysis of the aggregate State-wide waste stream.  Most of 
the solid waste generated in Georgia is collected and disposed in-State.   

The  Georgia  Department  of  Natural  Resources  Environmental  Protection  Division 
(“GA  DNR/EPD”)  compiles  quarterly  disposal  reports  from  the  State’s  landfills 
regarding the quantity of MSW that is disposed from each county.

1 The terms “disposed” and “disposal,” as used throughout the report, are intended to mean landfilled 
waste. 
2 Georgia’s definition of MSW is “any solid waste derived from households, including garbage, trash, 
and sanitary waste in septic tanks and solid waste from single-family and multifamily residences, hotels 
and motels, bunkhouses, campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day use recreation areas. The term includes 
yard trimmings and commercial solid waste but does not include solid waste from mining, agricultural 
or  silviculture  operations,  or  industrial  processes  or  operations.”  However,  sludge/biosolids  are 
excluded from this study.

Use  of  this  database  provides  valuable  information  about  the  MSW  landfills 
throughout  the  state  and  the  tonnage  of  MSW  that  each  facility  processes  from  any 
given  RDC.  Table  2-2  shows  estimated  MSW  tonnage  disposed  by  RDC  from  data 
reported by EPD. 

As part of this report, R.W. Beck did not attempted to validate EPD’s reported figures 
for RDC waste disposal.   

Information from Survey of Georgia Landfills 

Although  the  EPD  landfill  tonnage  database  is  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis,  the 
tonnage  data  may  not  be  exactly  accurate  and  may  include  tonnage  of  non-MSW 
waste going to MSW landfills, therefore varying the aggregate tonnage results.  Prior 
to  this  study,  R.W.  Beck  conducted  a  survey,  for  DCA,  of  63  Georgia  landfills  to 
determine  what  amount  of  non-MSW  waste  was  being  disposed  in  Georgia’s  MSW 
landfills.    DCA  had  reason  to  believe  that  a  significant  number  of  landfills  were 
accepting  a  potentially  large  fraction  of  non-MSW  waste  such  as  agricultural  waste, 
biosolids,  manufacturing  and  construction  and  demolition  waste.    Such  non-MSW 
waste  contributes  significantly  to  the  State’s  MSW  waste  stream  for  reporting 
purposes  and  for  measuring  the  State’s  progress  in  achieving  the  25  percent  waste 
reduction goal.  For purposes of the survey, four categories of waste were defined: 

(cid:131)  Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) 

(cid:131)  Construction/Demolition  

(cid:131) 

Industrial Waste 

(cid:131)  Sludge/Biosolids

Survey results showed that some landfills actually tracked materials by type and were 
able  to  derive  accurate  data  based  on  scale  records.    Most  landfills  did  not  track 
incoming waste by the categories in the survey.  These survey respondents estimated 
the proportion of each material type based on local knowledge of their customers, with 
some scale records for backup.  The survey relied on educated estimates from landfill 
operators and therefore contributes some uncertainty to the survey results.  Although it 
is  not  possible  to  accurately  verify  the  industrial  portion  of  the  State’s  waste  stream 
according to these results,  the  survey reflects  that approximately  two-thirds  of  waste 
going into Georgia’s municipal landfills is actually MSW.  Table 2-3 summarizes the 
results of the industrial waste survey (non-MSW survey).

Table  2-4  shows  the  adjusted  annual  disposal  tonnages  statewide  and  by  RDC  after 
applying the weighted average percentage of MSW actually being disposed at MSW 
landfills throughout the state. 

Waste Disposal by Season 

The MSW stream begins as materials discarded at households and businesses. These 
discarded materials vary greatly depending on household demographics or the nature 
of  a  business. This  variation  can  be  seen  in  the  composition  of  each  truck  and  each 
load delivered to a landfill. Solid waste also varies by season due to: 

(cid:132)  Tourism or seasonal residence use; 

(cid:132)  Holiday discards; 

(cid:132)  Variation  in  food  and  beverage  consumption  under  different  weather 

conditions; and  

(cid:132)  Growing season impacts on yard waste. 

Waste Disposal by Generating Sectors 

Georgia’s  State-level  reporting  system  currently  does  not  attempt  to  segregate  the 
waste stream into different generating sectors. Rather, waste quantities are reported in 
the  aggregate.    Due  to  budget  constraints,  it  was  determined  that  only  the  aggregate 
statewide  composition  of  the  waste  stream  would  be  developed  to  a  high  degree  of 
statistical precision. 

This Study does, however, present informative data on the composition of the several 
distinct generating sectors that make up the entire waste stream. This was done for the 
following generating sectors: 

(cid:132)  Residential  waste:    Waste  generated  in  detached  single-family  residences  that  are 
typically  served  via  routed  collection  by  a  hauler  using  specialized  waste  collection 
trucks or multi-family waste generated by multi-unit apartments and condominiums, and 
often collected via dumpster or cart service by a hauler using specialized waste collection 
trucks. 

(cid:132)  Commercial waste:  The commercial sector is highly variable, and includes waste from 
all  non-residential  sources  including  institutions,  businesses,  and  industrial  facilities 
(excluding  specially  classified  industrial  waste)  often  collected  by  a  hauler  using 
specialized waste collection trucks. 

2 Background DCA 20050622.doc 

R. W. Beck  2-7 

 
Section 2 

(cid:132)  Self-haul  waste:  Many  areas,  especially  rural  areas  where  curbside  collection  is  not 
widespread,  residents  and  even  some  businesses  (e.g.  contractors)  commonly  self-haul 
their waste for disposal, using cars, trucks, vans, and other non-packer trucks. This waste 
could be classified as residential, commercial, or mixed. 

(cid:132)  Transfer trailer waste:  Waste that is from distant locations is often reloaded into transfer 
trailers for more efficient long-hauling to a disposal site.  These samples often contain a 
mixture of waste from the sources described above. 

(cid:132)  Convenience center/greenbox waste:  In rural areas where no routed collection service 
exists,  there  may  be  a  network  of  convenience  centers  and/or  greenboxes  where  single 
family  residents,  as  well  as  some  multi-family  residents  and  businesses,  drop  off  their 
waste. This waste, also, could be classified as residential, commercial or mixed.

75 percent of MSW is disposed at private facilities. The other 25 percent is disposed at 
public facilities.

METHODOLOGY 

Introduction 

The  overall  purpose  of  this  waste  characterization  study  was  to  estimate  the 
composition of the State’s aggregate waste stream. This was done by taking samples of 
waste from across the Project area and sorting or characterizing the waste into various 
material groups and categories. Before a study can be performed, the study team will 
first  know  how  the  waste  stream  is  to  be  characterized.  In  other  words,  the  waste 
stream typically has materials made of paper, plastic, glass, etc. The Project team will 
determine to what finer level of detail the waste will be categorized. 

An  essential  part  of  a  waste  composition  study  is  the  development  of  a  sampling 
plan—the where, when, and how to take samples. The sampling plan for this project 
was developed so as to be within DCA’s available budget; encompass data collection 
from the greatest number of the RDCs; achieve seasonal representation; and capture a 
statistically  meaningful  number  of  samples  at  each  study  site.  Elements  of  the 
sampling plan include: 

(cid:131)  Distribution of samples across RDCs; 

(cid:131)  Seasonal distribution of samples; 

(cid:131)  Generating sectors to be targeted; 

(cid:131)  Host facility identification; and 

(cid:131)  Project schedule. 

Material Definitions 

R. W. Beck worked with the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (“DCA”) to 
define a list of disposed MSW material types that are of greatest interest to the State’s 
solid waste and recycling planners.  Seven major material groups were subdivided into 
39 individual materials categories for the purposes of the study.

 Sampling Plan 

As mentioned previously, the overall purpose of this waste characterization study was 
to estimate the composition of the State’s aggregate waste stream to a high degree of 
precision. In order to accurately characterize waste by using a sampling technique, the 
Project  team’s  objective  was  for  the  sampled  waste  to  very  closely  represent  the 
overall waste stream in the study region, (i.e., each RDC and the state of Georgia as a 
whole.) 

At  times,  circumstances  outside  the  control  of  the  Project  team  impacted  the  team’s 
ability to perfectly meet the waste composition study sampling plan. Sampling plans 
are  devised  with  backup  plans  and  other  built-in  quality  control  mechanisms.  It  is 
quite common for sampling plans to be adjusted during the study period.

Methodology 

A  detailed  sampling  plan  was  included  with  the  scope  of  work  for  this  study.  The 
original  plan  called  for  600  samples  to  be  obtained,  from  eight  MSW  disposal 
facilities, representing 13 of the State’s 16 RDCs. The original schedule intended there 
to be four sampling seasons from spring 2003 through winter 2004. 

The original plan was subsequently refined over the Project period. As a result, a total 
of 569 samples were sorted from 13 MSW recovery facilities, representing 13 of the 
State’s  16  RDCs. Actual  sampling  took  place  from  fall  2003  through  summer  2004. 
The  sections  below  describe  significant  elements  of  the  sampling  plan,  as  well  as  a 
summary of the sample breakdown.

Using  EPD’s  landfill  tonnage  reports  for  the  State-wide  analysis,  R.W.  Beck 
apportioned  the  State’s  disposed  waste  stream  by  RDC.    First,  a  list  of  landfills,  by 
RDC, was compiled.  Then the MSW tonnage data provided to EPD by each landfill 
was complied.  Each landfill in an RDC was ranked and landfills that reported taking 
in  the  most  waste  in  an  RDC  were  selected  to  host  a  waste  sort.    The  landfills 
reporting the most waste were targeted because the higher the percentage of the RDC 
waste  processed  at  these  facilities  relates  to  the  likelihood  of  obtaining  samples  that 
most represent waste for the RDC. 

To ensure statistical accuracy, any chosen facility had to receive no less than 25,000 
tons per year from the RDC being examined. 

Many landfills received MSW from more than one RDC. When applicable, the Project 
team targeted such facilities to provide a wider ranging study that minimizes logistical 
complications and provides a greater value for the DCA. 

Methodology for Sample Distribution by Season 

Waste  composition  has  been  shown  to  vary  by  season.    Certain  components  of  the 
MSW  stream—such  as  yard  waste,  construction  and  demolition  debris,  and  selected 
packaging  materials—are  known  to  occur  in  the  waste  stream  more  frequently  in 
certain  seasons.    To  assure  that  the  study  results  accurately  captured  variability 
associated  with  seasonal  changes  in  the  waste  stream,  field  data  collection  was 
performed during four seasons across a nine-month timeframe. 

Seasonal  sampling  distribution  also  provides  a  built-in  quality  control  mechanism, 
allowing  for  adjustments  in  the  sampling  plan  over  time,  when  needed,  to  keep  on 
course with Project objectives. 

Methodology for Sample Distribution by Generating Sector 

Nationwide waste sampling has shown that the MSW stream split between residential 
and  commercial  waste  most  often  ranges  between  60:40  and  40:60  residential  to 
commercial waste. Refuse trucks are specialized and normally only collect waste from 
one type of generating sector. However, there are instances when waste from a variety 
of generators may be delivered in one truck, (e.g., waste in transfer trailers delivered 

3 Method DCA 20050622.doc 

R. W. Beck  3-3 

 
 
Section 3 

from transfer stations where various truckloads of waste are combined and compacted 
and waste from convenience centers or greenboxes in rural areas.) 

For  purposes  of  the  Georgia  statewide  study,  the  Project  protocol  called  for  a  50:50 
distribution of residential and commercial waste samples from each studied RDC and 
statewide, because a Georgia-specific split was not known. This methodology allows 
for  a  ten  percent  margin  of  variance  one  way  or  another  to  still  fall  within  the 
nationwide average. The allowance for this variance was necessary, as determining the 
exact proportion of each generator of combined waste loads was deemed unlikely and 
cost prohibitive. 

Methodology for Sample Distribution by Landfill Type 

Knowing  that  75  percent  of  Georgia’s  MSW  stream  is  processed  through  private 
disposal  facilities,  the  Project  team  decided  to  originally  target  only  private  waste 
disposal sites as host facilities for sampling operations.  

In  the  event  that  a  targeted  private  facility  was  unable  or  unwilling  to  participate, 
public facilities in each of the State’s RDCs were identified as backup sites. 

Again,  the  ultimate  goal  was  to  have  a  sample  stream  that  closely  represented  the 
MSW  stream  of  the  study  region  –  75  percent  of  the  samples  from  private  facilities 
and 25 percent from public facilities. 

Pre-Study Sampling Plan 

In order to complete RDC geographic distribution for the original project budget, eight 
private landfills were initially selected for the sort. Two years passed from the time the 
Project scope was written and the time sorting was to begin. Originally, the seasonal 
distribution  was  scheduled  over  the  four  season  period  from  spring  2003  through 
winter  2004.  However,  Solid  Waste  Trust  Fund  budget  uncertainties  and  timing 
constraints  between  the  scope  submittal  and  Project  initiation  made  it  necessary  to 
adjust the Project timetable.

Thirteen public facilities were identified – one for each targeted RDC – in the event 
logistical  problems  arose  for  the  originally  targeted  host  sites.  Table  3-3  lists  the 
backup sampling locations that were identified by the Project team. 

 Post-Study Sampling Plan 

Subsequent to the fall sort, R.W. Beck notified DCA of obstacles preventing sampling 
at some private and backup public facilities.  Some entities denied sorting staff access 
to  their  facilities,  despite  prior  notification  via  written  letters  and  telephone 
correspondence from R.W. Beck and representatives of the DCA. Another obstacle to 
completing the seasonal sort as originally planned included the state enforced closure 
of  the  Live  Oak  landfill.  In  addition,  logistical  issues  became  apparent  at  some 
facilities.  One  example  was  a  landfill  that  received  most  of  its  MSW  via  transfer 
trailers. The facility was constructed in such a way that the truck loads were removed 
using an apparatus to literally lift the semi trailers and dump their loads – one on top 
of another – in a giant pit. There would be no way for the Project team to select one 
sample independent from others. 

The issue involving gaining access to host facility sites warrants further discussion. In 
agreement with the DCA, the project team went through extraordinary efforts to obtain 
access to private facilities, in an attempt to remain true to the regionally representative 
sampling methodology. The most common objection raised related to safety concerns. 
One  agreement  for  access  required  documentation  of  safety  training  of  all  on-site 
Project  members,  a  request  for  extending  R. W. Beck  insurance  to  cover  the  private 
party,  and  legal  waivers.  Though  R. W. Beck  has  an  extensive  safety  plan  and  sort 
training  protocol,  time  was  required  for  negotiations  and  to  gather  and  produce  all 
required  documentation.  In  another  instance,  facility  managers  were  hesitant  to  host

Methodology 

sorting  operations  because  of  space  limitations  due  to  new  cell  construction.  The 
Project  team  was  able  to  work  with  the  facility  and  state  permitting  authorities  to 
obtain a special amendment to the facility’s permit to allow for additional space to be 
used for a sample staging and sorting area. The site access delays caused the second 
seasonal sort to begin three months behind schedule.  Instead of starting in November 
2003, the Winter sort started February 9, 2004.

Due  to  the  above-mentioned  unforeseen  obstacles,  the  sampling  plan  was  revised. 
Facilities  were  replaced  and  the  sort  period  lost  some  months  in  the  timeline. 
Subsequently, the number of samples to obtain was reduced but remained sufficient to

satisfy  the  need  for  statistical  validity.  Table  3-4  represents  the  sampling  plan  that 
actually took place for all four season sorts, including the sort seasons and the number 
of samples included in each sort. 

In total, four seasonal sampling and sorting events were performed: 

•  Fall: 

End of September through mid-October 2003 

•  Winter: 

Early February through end of February 2004 

•  Spring:  

End of April through mid-May 2004 

•  Summer:  End of August through mid September 2004 

The  fall  and  winter  events  featured  approximately  2  ½  weeks  (18  days)  of  field 
sorting, while the spring and summer events featured approximately 4 weeks (26 days) 
of field sorting.  Field data collection was initiated in the fall of 2003 and concluded in 
the summer of 2004.

Table 3-5 summarizes the facilities and dates on which sampling and sorting actually 
took place over the four seasons. 

These 13 facilities were targeted because of the extended wastesheds from which they 
receive waste.  Sampling waste from these 13 facilities generated composition data for 
13 of the 16 RDCs. 

Sorting specifics are described below: 

(cid:132)  Pecan Row (1 sort event)  Located in the South Georgia RDC, 40 samples were targeted 

at this facility during one season of sorting.

Figure  3-1  presents  a  map  of  Georgia  showing  the  location  of  each  of  the  host 
facilities within each RDC.  As shown, these facilities were distributed across various 
regions of the State, and allowed the project team to obtain a wide variety of sample 
material from many different local waste management systems. 

Sampling and Sorting 

Once access was obtained to host facilities, an appropriate sampling plan was devised, 
and field data was collected. Field data collection included three primary tasks:   

(1) Identifying and taking samples from targeted truckloads originating in each of 

the generating sectors identified in the sampling plan;  

(2) Sorting each sample into the target material categories; and  

(3) Recording the weight of sorted materials in each category. 

These steps are described below. 

Sampling and Sorting Team Positions and Responsibilities 

Each sampling and sorting team was made up of five to seven people – a Field Supervisor, a 
Crew  Chief,  and  a  crew  of  about  five  sorters.  The  Field  Supervisor  was  responsible  for 
working  with  the  facility  staff  and  setting  up  the  sort  field  site.  Additionally,  the  Field

Methodology 

Supervisor kept track of the schedules, sampling plans, and general sort logistics. The Crew 
Chief was responsible for management of the sort crew. 

Sampling 

Proper  sampling  requires  that  the  origin  and  contents  of  each  sampled  truckload  be 
verified  prior  to  taking  samples.    Each  day  of  the  field  data  collection  (at  the 
appropriate  disposal  facility),  the  Field  Supervisors  were  provided  with  a  list  of  the 
trucks  and  the  number  and  type  of  loads  to  be  targeted  for  that  day’s  sampling  and 
sorting.  Truckloads were selected using a stratified random sampling methodology to 
select  incoming  vehicles  for  sampling.    This  means  that  trucks  were  selected  at 
random but in proportion to the number of loads from each specific hauler delivering 
waste to the facility. 

When  targeted  trucks  entered  the  facility,  the  Field  Supervisor  conducted  a  brief 
interview  with  the  driver  to  verify  certain  information  about  the  contents  of  the 
truckload.  Questions included: 

(cid:132) 

Is the load residential, commercial, or mixed? 

(cid:132)  Where did the material originate (specific geographic origin)? 

(cid:132)  Were any out-of-the-ordinary items picked up on route? 

(cid:132) 

(cid:132) 

Is the driver the regular route driver or a substitute? (This question helped gauge 
route familiarity.) 

Is this a special load?  (This question served to verify that material was picked up 
from the targeted generating sector.) 

The hauling company name and truck number was recorded so that the origin of the 
load  could  be  verified  at  a  later  time.  Drivers  of  self-hauled  loads  were  asked  to 
identify  the  generator  class  (residential,  commercial,  industrial,  etc.).    The  type  and 
size of the vehicle used for self-hauling waste and other relevant information was also 
noted. 

At each host facility, a designated area was established to conduct the sorting.  Trucks 
that were selected for sampling were directed to tip their loads in a location designated 
by facility personnel, ideally adjacent to both the normal tipping area and the sort area.  
The  Field  Supervisor  worked  with  a  facility-designated  loader  operator  to  randomly 
select a  200- to 250-pound sample to be staged next to the sorting area.  The loader 
operator was directed by the Field Supervisor to place the sample on a plastic tarp, so 
that smaller particles, or “fines”, could be captured.  The remaining (unsampled) waste 
was then processed at the facility in the normal manner. 

Industry literature specifies a minimum sample size of 200 pounds, which is consistent 
with  R. W. Beck’s  past  sorting  experience.    However,  in  any  field  sort,  it  is  to  be 
expected that occasional samples will weigh less than the 200-pound target because of 
variation  in  the  density  of  the  waste.   This  discrepancy  is  more  likely  to  occur  with 
commercial  loads  that  contain  a  significant  fraction  of  corrugated  boxes,  foam 
packaging,  or  other  light  material.    Conversely,  some  of  the  denser  samples  may  be 
significantly  heavier  than  200  pounds.  Because  the  data  analysis  was  performed  by 

3 Method DCA 20050622.doc 

R. W. Beck  3-11 

 
 
Section 3 

averaging the percentage composition of all the samples, and not on the actual weight 
of the sample, heavy or light samples are not over- or under-weighted in the results. 
Less  than  6  percent  of  samples  were  significantly  (more  than  10  percent)  below  the 
target sample weight.  

Specific samples were selected by visually dividing the load or an unbiased portion of 
the  load  into  six  to  eight  rectangular  cells,  then  using  a  random  number  table  to 
determine from which cell to collect the sample. Due to facility traffic and scheduling 
constraints, it was occasionally necessary to take more than one sample from a load. In 
such  instances,  two  cells  were  randomly  selected.  To  minimize  bias,  the  loader 
operator  was  directed  to  take  a  vertical  slice  from  the  pile  at  the  selected  cell  of  the 
load. As a precaution – and when facility and R. W. Beck safety protocols permitted – 
the visible characteristics of the full waste load were observed by the Field Supervisor. 

Sorting 

All  sorting  was  conducted  in  a  designated  area  of  the  host  site,  out  of  the  way  of 
ongoing facility operations. Facilities, to the best of their space limitations, supplied a 
900  square  foot  work  area,  with  access  to  utilities,  a  lunch/break  room  with  running 
water (for clean-up), and restrooms.  In addition to the 900 square foot work area, the 
host facilities offered space to stage up to four samples awaiting sorting (roughly 100 
square feet each) on the ground in the vicinity of the work area. 

Once  samples  were  staged  for  sorting,  each  sample  was  manually  loaded  onto  a 
specially  designed sorting table.  Bagged  waste was carried to the table, while loose 
waste was scooped and loaded into a 40-gallon container to be moved to the table top.  
Certain large or bulky items were carried to a scale for direct weighing. 

At the sort table, which was covered by half-inch screening, solid waste was manually 
sorted  into  labeled  bins  or  baskets.    Bagged  or  boxed  materials  were  opened  and  all 
waste  was  sorted.    Sorting  continued  until  the  screen-top  material  reached  a  particle 
size of one-half to two inches.  Material particles ranging from one-half to two inches 
(typically  shredded  paper,  plastic  caps  and  lids,  etc.)  were  apportioned  to  the 
appropriate  material  category  by  the  Crew  Chief.    When  the  half-inch  screen  was 
cleared  of  material,  the  layer  of  fines  beneath  the  screen  was  placed  in  a  “fines” 
category.  Special effort was made to totally separate all waste above the screen into 
the component material categories and remove or shake off to the appropriate category 
as much contamination (grit and moisture) as possible. 

Manual sorting was performed by a crew of about four or five sorters, typically light-
industrial temporary laborers.  All sorting personnel were trained in the specific safety 
and  technical  requirements  of  this  sorting  protocol  prior  to  performing  the  sort.   An 
average of ten 200-pound samples was manually sorted by each crew during an eight- 
to ten-hour day.  All samples were manually sorted into the 39 categories of material 
defined by DCA.

Methodology 

Moisture Analysis 

After the first season of field data collection, DCA and R. W. Beck discussed possible 
accuracy issues when characterizing the composition of samples delivered by transfer 
trailers. At transfer stations, waste is handled and piled up by heavy machinery. It was 
thought  that  this  additional  handling  could  result  in  higher  levels  of  cross-
contamination  –  where  porous  materials  absorb  moisture  and  wet,  sticky  materials 
adhere to others causing them to be heavier – that would potentially skew the average 
percent composition by weight of the samples. Though this possibility is common to 
all  waste  composition  studies  –  and  only  a  small  percentage  of  studies  perform 
moisture  analysis  and  adjust  data  –  the  project  team  decided  to  evaluate  this 
hypothesis and make corrections to the data if it proved to be a significant issue. 

During the three remaining sort seasons, portions of selected materials, from random 
samples, were sent to the environmental engineering lab at the University of Florida 
where the moisture content in various samples was determined and compared.

analysis. 

The  results  of  the  moisture  analysis,  by  generating  sector  and  on  average,  are 
discussed in Section 4. 

Data Recording 

On the first and last day of a sorting event at a facility, the Crew Chief recorded tare 
weights for each of the containers used in the sort.  Tare weights must be backed out 
from gross container weights to obtain accurate net material weight data. 

After material from a given sample was sorted into the appropriate bin, the Crew Chief 
and sorters systematically weighed and recorded the gross weights of containers on an 
individual data collection sheet.  Bulky items too large to fit into a labeled container 
were weighed out separately and recorded as net weights.  Especially large items were 
noted on the data collection sheet.  All weights were recorded to the nearest 0.1 pound.  
A blank data recording form is included in Appendix O. 

Weighed material was deposited in an adjacent area or in a container designated and 
provided  by  the  facility,  to  await  final  processing/disposal.    For  facilities  with 
recyclable  material  handling  capability,  and  provided  that  facility  management  was 
able to supply a suitable container for collection and transport, sorted recyclables were 
kept separate for processing rather than disposal.  

R. W. Beck provided all sorting baskets/containers; tables; a digital scale (with a 500-
pound capacity and accurate to 0.1 pound); signs/labels; data forms; hand tools; tarps 
and  other  ground  cover;  protective  clothing  and  other  safety-related  equipment  not 
already on site.

Table 3-8 compares the targeted number of samples with the actual number of samples 
obtained in the study by Regional Development Center. 

In  total,  95  percent  of  the  targeted  samples  were  obtained.  Some  of  the  sampling 
shortfalls  were  caused  by  operational  obstacles  beyond  the  Project  team’s  control, 
such as those described earlier in this section. Additionally, one sample was eliminated 
from the analysis based on a quality control review designed to exclude samples with 
a weight insufficient for statistical validity.

Statistical Measures 

Within  each  of  the  RDC  result  sets,  this  report  presents  several  statistical  measures.  
These are described below: 

Sample  Mean  –  The  sample  mean  composition  is  the  average  composition  of  each 
material  category  (or  material  group)  for  the  samples  included  in  a  given  result  set.  
Because it is conceptually easy to understand, the sample mean values are often cited 
as a definitive estimate of the actual mean (i.e., the mean of the entire population).  It 
is important to remember that the sample mean has associated uncertainty, described 
below. 

Standard Deviation – The standard deviation measures the level of dispersion of the 
underlying  data  around  the  sample  mean.    Higher  standard  deviation  indicates  the 
individual  data  points  are  more  widely  variant  (i.e.,  spread  across  a  wider  range) 
compared to lower standard deviation. 

Confidence  Intervals  –  The  lower  and  upper  confidence  intervals  indicate  the 
likelihood  that  the  population  mean  (i.e.,  the  actual  composition  of  the  entire  waste 
stream) falls close to the sample mean (i.e., the samples analyzed in the study).  The 
lower  and  upper  bound  throughout  this  report  have  been  calculated  at  a  90  percent

Methodology 

level of confidence.  In layman’s terms, this means we can be 90 percent confident that 
the true fraction of this material in the overall population falls between the lower and 
upper bound shown.  The inverse is also true—that there is a ten percent chance that 
the true mean falls outside the intervals.  For example, the sample mean composition 
of all paper in the Atlanta Regional Commission RDC samples was 40.0 percent.  We 
can  be  90  percent  confident  that  the  actual fraction  of  paper  in  the  state’s  municipal 
solid waste stream falls between 37.7 percent and 42.3 percent. 

Complete results of the analysis of all sample data are shown in the remaining sections 
and appendices of this report.

STATEWIDE MSW COMPOSITION 

Interpretation of Results 

This section provides a detailed summary of the aggregate composition of Georgia’s 
disposed  municipal  solid  waste  stream.    Within  the  section  are  many  graphical  and 
tabular  summaries  of  statewide  municipal  solid  waste  composition.    To  adequately 
interpret these data, it is important to have a layman’s understanding of the statistical 
analysis  that  was  used  to  generate  the  results.    Details  of  the  statistical  analysis  are 
described in the “Methodology” section of this report. 

Throughout  this  section,  material  names  are  used  to  categorize  waste  in  the  MSW 
stream. Definitions of these material categories can be found in Appendix N. 

Aggregation of Data 

A  total  of  568  samples  –  more  than  60  tons  of  waste  –  were  sorted  for  this  study.  
Preparing the statewide results for the study involved multiple steps of analyzing and 
aggregating  these  samples.    The  statewide  results  presented  here  actually  represent 
several  layers  of  statistical  analysis  and  aggregation.    RDC  averages  were  first 
produced. Then  the  RDC  figures  were  turned  into  a  state  average  using  a  weighted 
average process. The results of these calculations are the focal point of the study and 
are shown in this section. 

Moisture Analysis 

A limited number of moisture samples were taken for this study in order to evaluate 
whether  the  process  of  transferring  waste  leads  to  increased  levels  of  cross-
contamination.  Results  of  the  moisture  analysis  performed  did  not  support  that 
hypothesis.

The  table  above  shows  the  results  of  the  moisture  analysis  by  generating  sector. 
Though  a  slight  variation  can  be  seen  in  the  sample  mean  averages  between 
generating sectors, transfer trailer moisture percentages were only found to be higher 
than  the  average  moisture  percentages  for  slightly  more  than  half  of  the  material 
categories. Statistically no difference can be asserted for the actual mean (the mean of 
the entire population).  Adjustment to data for moisture content was not performed.

Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States: 2003 Data Tables”. 
The  nation-wide  data  includes  “generated”  materials  (including  waste  that  was 
recycled or composted) and data for “disposed” waste in the US. The Georgia state-
wide  results  in  this  report  indicate  “disposed”  materials  –  meaning  these  numbers 
show the amounts of waste that were not recycled or composted.

As Table 4-3 indicates, more paper is disposed, on average, in Georgia than in the US. 
The  amount  of  yard  waste  disposed  in  Georgia’s  MSW  stream  is  considerably  less 
than in the US MSW stream. The Georgia Comprehensive Solid Waste Management 
Act  places  restrictions  on  yard  waste  in  Georgia’s  MSW  stream,  therefore  a  lower 
than average amount should be expected.

Figure  4-4  focuses  on  the  tons  of  commonly  recycled  materials  that  were  disposed.  
Overall, paper was found to be disposed in significant quantities in Georgia. Nearly 
twenty-five percent of the adjusted disposed municipal solid waste stream (6,685,002 
tons)  is  commonly  recycled  paper  materials  (1,657,524  tons).  Recyclable  metals, 
glass,  and  plastics  were  found  at  relatively  lower  disposal  rates  –  five  percent,  four 
percent and two percent respectively – but still significant quantities.  This suggests 
the  State  may  be  able  to  increase  diversion  from  landfills  by  evaluating  recycling 
market development strategies, recycling outreach activities, and residential recycling 
incentive programs.

Figure  4-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
statewide disposed waste stream.  Statewide, food waste makes up the largest fraction 
of disposed waste at 12.0 percent, followed by corrugated cardboard (11.0 percent), 
nonrecyclable paper (10.5 percent), and film plastic (7.4 percent).  Newspaper makes 
up  4.8  percent  of  the  waste  stream  while  miscellaneous  rigid  plastics  and  textiles 
make up 4.4 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively.  No other materials make up more 
than 4.0 percent of the State-wide waste stream.  The top ten most prevalent materials 
make up 63.8 percent of the disposed waste stream.

2 There has been a rise in the plastic content in the disposed waste stream for many years, as more and 
more  products  are  manufactured  using  plastics.  MSW  disposal  contributions  from  plastic  bags  and 
other film plastics are commonly ranging from 5 to 8 percent as published in recent reports for New 
York City, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

Table  4-3  shows  a  comparison  of  the  amounts  of  materials  in  the  residential, 
commercial and transfer trailer MSW streams. Definitions of the material categories 
may be found in Appendix N. Transfer trailer waste contains materials from both the 
residential  and  commercial  MSW  streams.  For  most  material  categories,  the 
percentage in the transfer trailer waste is between the amounts in the residential and 
commercial MSW. Transfer trailer waste, however, may also contain construction and 
demolition (“C&D”), and industrial-type materials. This is evident in the total amount 
of C&D in the transfer trailer MSW. 

The  residential  waste  contains  more  of  newspapers,  magazines,  and  paperboard. 
Commercial  waste  contains  more  corrugated  cardboard  and  office  paper.  Plastics 
appear  at  a  comparable  rate  in  all  three  streams,  with  residential  having  a  slightly 
higher amount of PET and HDPE. Glass, metals, organics, and inorganics also appear 
at a similar rate in all three streams.

The  charts  in  Figures  4-6  through  4-8  compare  the  composition  percentage  by 
material group for residential, commercial, and transfer trailer waste in Georgia.   

Figure 4-6 shows the top 10 most prevalent materials in Georgia Residential Waste.  
Food waste is disposed in the highest quantity, with other paper (non-recyclable) and 
film plastic as the second and third highest disposed items respectively.  Note that, in 
the  residential  MSW  disposal  stream,  corrugated  cardboard  places  fifth  highest  in 
materials disposed.  However, when comparing the residential generating sector to the 
commercial  and  transfer  trailer  generating  sectors  (Figures  4-7  and  4-8),  the  latter 
show corrugated cardboard disposed in the highest quantity, with food waste placing 
second in the commercial sector and third in the transfer trailer sector. 

Yard  waste  makes  up  three  percent  of  the  states  commercial  MSW  stream.  Though 
yard  waste  is  more  prevalent  in  certain  regions,  it  does  not  appear  to  be  strictly  a 
regional  issue  –  five  of  the  13  regions  studied  have  yard  waste  in  the  top  10  most 
prevalent materials in their commercial MSW streams.

Figures  4-9  through  4-11  compare  the  amount  of  commonly  recycled  materials 
disposed in the municipal solid waste stream by generating sector.  Note that paper is 
being  disposed  of  in  the  highest  quantities  from  all  three  generating  sectors,  with 
metal  as  the  second  highest  item  disposed.    This  suggests  that  the  State  can  target 
programs  for  additional  diversion  opportunities  for  paper  and  metal  in  all  three 
generating sectors. 

Conclusions 

The aggregate Georgia disposed MSW composition shown in this section highlights 
the percentages and quantities of materials that are still being disposed in the State’s 
landfills, MSW composting, and waste-to-energy facilities.  Solid waste planners can 
use  these  results  to  better  target  the  materials  that  have  the  highest  potential  for 
additional  diversion.    Appendices  A  through  M  of  this  report  provide  comparable 
results for 13 of the State’s 16 RDCs.

This  section  of  the  report  presents  the  results  for  the  Atlanta  Regional  Commission 
Regional  Development  Center,  which  includes  Cherokee,  Clayton,  Cobb,  DeKalb, 
Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, and Rockdale counties. 

In order to develop composition estimates for this RDC, field sampling was performed 
at three waste processing and disposal facilities: 

(cid:132)  DeKalb County Landfill 

(cid:132)  Oak Grove Landfill; and 

App A ARC RDC Results DCA 20050622.doc   6/22/05 

 
 
Appendix A 

(cid:132)  Atlanta North Transfer Station. 

Sampling at these facilities was performed across four seasons to account for seasonal 
variation in MSW composition.

Table  A-1  shows  the  actual  disposal  tonnage  reported  to  the  state  and  the  adjusted 
annual  disposal  tonnages  after  applying  the  weighted  average  percentage  of  MSW 
actually  being  disposed  at  MSW  landfills  throughout  the  state.  The  adjusted  tons  of 
MSW are used throughout this report.

Figure A-2 presents the aggregate composition of major material groups in the Atlanta 
Regional Commission RDC’s disposed municipal solid waste stream. As shown, paper 
and organics make up the largest fractions of the waste stream, followed by plastics.  
Metals  and  C&D  made  up  the  fourth  and  fifth  largest  fractions  of  the  waste  stream, 
with glass and inorganics making up the smallest portion of the waste stream.

Figure A-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of the Atlanta Regional Commission 
RDC’s waste that are estimated to be disposed in the State’s landfills (based on 2003 
EPD facility reports).  In absolute terms, nearly 1.3 million tons of paper and over 0.8 
million tons of organics were the highest tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

Figure  A-4  focuses  on  the  tons  of  commonly  recycled  materials  that  were  disposed.  
Overall,  paper  was  found  to  be  disposed  in  significant  quantities  in  the  Atlanta 
Regional Commission RDC. More than 25 percent of all disposed waste is commonly 
recycled paper. Commonly recycled metals, glass and plastics were found at relatively 
lower  disposal  rates  –  six  percent,  four  percent  and  three  percent  respectively.  The 
Atlanta Regional Commission RDC very closely relates to the state as a whole.

 Figure  A-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Atlanta Regional Commission RDC disposed waste stream.  Food waste makes up the 
largest  fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  12.2  percent,  followed  by  corrugated  cardboard 
(11.3  percent),  nonrecyclable  paper  (10.6  percent)  and  film  plastic  (7.5  percent).  
Newspaper  makes  up  4.9  percent  of  the  waste  stream  while  miscellaneous  rigid 
plastics make up 4.3 percent.  No other materials make up more than 4.0 percent of the 
RDC-wide waste stream.  The top ten most prevalent materials make up 65.0 percent 
of the RDC’s disposed waste stream.

Figure  A-7  shows  the  top  10  most  prevalent  materials  in  Atlanta  Regional 
Commission  RDC’s  Residential  Waste.    Food  waste  is  disposed  in  the  highest 
quantity,  with  other  paper  (non-recyclable)  and  film  plastic  as  the  second  and  third 
highest  disposed  items  respectively.    Note  that,  in  the  residential  MSW  generating 
stream,  corrugated  cardboard  places  fifth  highest  in  materials  disposed.    However, 
when comparing the residential generating sector to the commercial and transfer trailer 
generating  sectors  (Figures  A-8  and  A-9),  the  latter  show  corrugated  cardboard 
disposed  in  the  highest  quantity,  with  food  waste  placing  second  in  the  commercial 
sector and forth in the transfer trailer sector.

This section of the report presents the results for the Central Savannah River Regional 
Development Center, which includes Burke, Columbia, Glascock, Hancock, Jefferson, 
Jenkins, Lincoln, McDuffie, Richmond, Taliaferro, Warren, Washington, and Wilkes 
counties. 

In order to develop composition estimates for this RDC, field sampling was performed 
at two waste processing and disposal facilities:

Figure B-2 presents the aggregate composition of major material groups in the Central 
Savannah River Area RDC’s disposed municipal solid waste stream. As shown, paper 
and organics make up the largest fractions of the waste stream, followed by plastics.  
Glass  and  metals  made  up  the  fourth  and  fifth  largest  fractions  of  the  waste  stream, 
with  construction  and  demolition  debris  and  inorganics  making  up  the  smallest 
portions of the waste stream.

Figure B-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of the Central Savannah River Area 
RDC’s waste that are estimated to be disposed in the State’s landfills (based on 2003 
EPD facility reports).  In absolute terms, nearly 74,000 tons of paper and 64,000 tons 
of organics were the highest tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

Figure B-4 focuses on the tons of commonly recycled materials that were disposed in 
the  RDC.    Overall,  paper  was  found  to  be  disposed  in  significant  quantities  in  the 
Central Savannah River Area RDC. Over 23 percent of all waste disposed in this RDC 
is commonly recycled paper. Commonly recycled glass, metal and plastics were found 
at  relatively  lower  disposal  rates  –  five  percent,  five  percent  and  three  percent 
respectively.

Figure  B-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Central  Savannah  River  Area  RDC’s  disposed  waste  stream.    Food  waste  makes  up 
the  largest  fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  14.0  percent,  followed  by  corrugated 
cardboard  (8.5  percent),  film  plastic  (8.4  percent),  and  nonrecyclable  paper 
(7.0 percent).    Newspaper  makes  up  6.9  percent  of  the  waste  stream,  textiles 
6.1 percent, paperboard 5.4 percent and miscellaneous rigid plastics 4.2 percent of the 
RDC’s wastestream.  No other materials make up more than 4.0 percent of the RDC-
wide waste stream.  The top ten most prevalent materials make up 66.7 percent of the 
disposed waste stream in the RDC.

Figure B-7 shows the top 10 most prevalent materials in the Central Savannah River 
Area RDC’s Residential Waste.  Food waste is disposed in the highest quantity, with 
newspaper  and  film  plastic  as  the  second  and  third  highest  disposed  items, 
respectively.  Note  that,  in  the  residential  MSW  generating  stream,  corrugated 
cardboard places eighth highest in materials disposed.  However, when comparing the 
residential generating sector to the commercial and transfer trailer generating sectors 
(Figures  B-8  and  B-9),  the  latter  show  corrugated  cardboard  disposed  in  the  second 
and  highest  quantity,  with  food  waste  placing  first  in  the  commercial  sector  and 
second in the transfer trailer sector.

Figures  B-10  compares  the  amount  of  commonly  recycled  materials  disposed  in  the 
RDC’s  municipal  solid  waste  stream  by  generating  sector.    Note  that  paper  is  being 
disposed  of  in  the  highest  quantities  from  all  three  generating  sectors.  Glass  is  the 
second  most  prevalent  commonly  recycled  material  in  the  residential  sector,  but  is 
third  most  prevalent  in  the  commercial  and  transfer  sectors  –  metal  is  the  second 
highest.

This  section  of  the  report  presents  the  results  for  the  Chattahoochee  Flint  Regional 
Development Center, which includes Carroll, Coweta, Heard, Merriwether, and Troup 
counties. 

In order to develop composition estimates for this RDC, field sampling was performed 
at the LaGrange public landfill.

Figure  C-2  presents  the  aggregate  composition  of  major  material  groups  in  the 
Chattahoochee Flint RDC’s disposed municipal solid waste stream. As shown, paper 
and organics make up the largest fractions of the waste stream, followed by plastics.  
Metals  and  glass  made  up  the  fourth  and  fifth  largest  fractions  of  the  waste  stream, 
with C&D and inorganics making up the smallest portion of the waste stream.

Figure  C-3  shows  a  bar  graph  of  the  actual  tons  of  the  Chattahoochee  Flint  RDC’s 
waste  that  are  estimated  to  be  disposed  in  the  State’s  landfills  (based  on  2003  EPD 
facility reports).  In absolute terms, nearly 73,000 tons of paper and nearly 46,000 tons 
of organics were the highest tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

 Figure C-4 focuses on the tons of commonly recycled materials that  were disposed.  
Overall, paper was found to be disposed in significant quantities in the RDC. Over 20 
percent  of  all  material  disposed  in  Chattahoochee  Flint  (and  half  of  all  paper)  is 
commonly recycled paper. Commonly recycled metals, glass, and plastics were found 
at  relatively  lower  disposal  rates  –  seven  percent,  four  percent  and  three  percent 
respectively.

 Figure  C-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Chattahoochee  Flint  RDC’s  disposed  waste  stream.    Across  the  RDC,  nonrecyclable 
paper  makes  up  the  largest  fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  12.4  percent,  followed  by 
food  waste  (11.5  percent),  corrugated  cardboard  (9.6  percent),  and  film  plastic 
(7.8 percent).  Newspaper makes up 5.0 percent of the waste stream, while “fines” and 
paperboard  make  up  4.5  percent  and  4.2  percent,  respectively.    No  other  materials 
make  up  more  than  4.0  percent  of  the  RDC-wide  waste  stream.    The  top  ten  most 
prevalent materials make up 65.6 percent of the disposed waste stream.

Figure D-2 presents the aggregate composition of major material groups in the Coastal 
Georgia RDC’s disposed municipal solid waste stream. As shown, paper and organics 
make  up  the  largest  fractions  of  the  waste  stream,  followed  by  plastics.    C&D  and 
metals  made  up  the  fourth  and  fifth  largest  fractions  of  the  waste  stream,  with  glass 
and inorganics making up the smallest portion of the waste stream.

Figure D-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of the RDC’s waste that are estimated 
to  be  disposed  in  the  State’s  landfills  (based  on  2003  EPD  facility  reports).    In 
absolute terms, nearly 180,000 tons of paper and over 128,000 tons of organics were 
the highest tons of material disposed in the RDC during 2003-2004.

 Figure D-4 focuses on the tons of commonly recycled materials that were disposed.  
Overall,  paper  was  found  to  be  disposed  in  significant  quantities  in  the  Coastal 
Georgia  RDC.  Nearly  28 percent  of  all  waste  disposed  in  the  RDC  is  commonly 
recycled  paper.  Recyclable  metals,  glass  and  plastics  were  found  at  relatively  lower 
disposal rates – four percent, four percent and two percent respectively.

 Figure  D-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Coastal  Georgia  RDC’s  disposed  waste  stream.    Across  the  RDC,  corrugated 
cardboard makes up the largest fraction of disposed waste at 15.0 percent, followed by 
food  waste  (11.1  percent),  film  plastic  (7.9  percent)  and  other,  nonrecyclable  paper 
(7.7 percent).  Newspaper makes up 4.5 percent of the waste stream, wood makes up 
4.4 percent, and textiles and other rigid plastics make up 4.2 percent each.  No other 
materials make up more than 4.0 percent of the RDC-wide waste stream.  The top ten 
most prevalent materials make up 65.8 percent of the disposed waste stream.

Figure D-7 shows the top 10 most prevalent materials in the Coastal Georgia RDC’s 
Residential  Waste.    Food  waste  is  disposed  in  the  highest  quantity,  with  other  paper 
(non-recyclable)  and  newspaper  as  the  second  and  third  highest  disposed  items 
respectively.    Note  that  in  the  residential  MSW  generating  stream  corrugated 
cardboard  places  fifth  highest  in  materials  disposed.    However,  when  comparing  the 
residential generating sector to the commercial and transfer trailer generating sectors 
(Figures  D-8  and  D-9),  the  latter  show  corrugated  cardboard  disposed  in  the  highest 
quantity, with food waste placing second in both sectors.

Figure  D-10  compares  the  amount  of  commonly  recycled  materials  disposed  in  the 
RDC’s  municipal  solid  waste  stream  by  generating  sector.    Note  that  paper  is  being 
disposed  of  in  the  highest  quantities  from  all  three  generating  sectors,  with  metal  as 
the second highest item disposed.

Figure  E-2  presents  the  aggregate  composition  of  major  material  groups  in  Coosa 
Valley RDC’s disposed municipal solid waste stream. As shown, paper and organics 
make up the largest fractions of the waste stream, followed by plastics.  C&D debris 
makes up the fourth largest fraction of the waste stream. Metal and glass make up the 
same percentage of the waste stream with inorganics making up the smallest portion.

Figure E-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of RDC’s waste that are estimated to 
be disposed in the State’s landfills (based on 2003 EPD facility reports).  In absolute 
terms, nearly 98,000 tons of paper and over 93,000 tons of organics were the highest 
tons of material disposed in the RDC during 2003-2004.

 Figure  E-4  focuses  on  the  tons  of  commonly  recycled  materials  that  were  disposed.  
Overall, paper was found to be disposed in significant quantities in the Coosa Valley 
RDC.  More  than  19  percent  of  all  waste  disposed  is  made  of  commonly  recycled 
paper. Recyclable metals, glass and plastics were found in equal amounts and make up 
four percent of the waste stream each.

 Figure  E-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
RDC’s  disposed  waste  stream.    Across  the  RDC,  food  waste  makes  up  the  largest 
fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  13.4  percent,  followed  by  nonrecyclable  paper 
(11.9 percent), film plastic (6.2 percent) and newspaper (6.2 percent).  Textiles make 
up 5.5 percent of the waste stream, diapers 5.2 percent and miscellaneous rigid plastics 
5.0  percent.  Yard  waste  makes  up  4.8  percent  of  the  waste  stream  while  corrugated 
cardboard make up 4.6 percent.  No other materials make up more than 4.0 percent of 
the  RDC-wide  waste  stream.    The  top  ten  most  prevalent  materials  make  up 
66.2 percent of the disposed waste stream.

Coosa Valley Composition 

Figure  E-7  shows  the  top  10  most  prevalent  materials  in  the  Coosa  Valley  RDC 
Residential Waste.  Nonrecyclable paper is disposed in the highest quantity, with food 
waste  and  newspaper  as  the  second  and  third  highest  disposed  items  respectively.  
Note  that  in  the  residential  MSW  generating  stream  corrugated  cardboard  does  not 
appear  in  the  ten  highest  materials  disposed.    However,  when  comparing  the 
residential  generating  sector  to  the  commercial  sector  (Figure  E-8),  the  latter  shows 
corrugated  cardboard  disposed  in  the  third  highest  quantity,  with  food  waste  placing 
first.

Figure  E-9  compares  the  amount  of  commonly  recycled  materials  disposed  in  the 
RDC’s  municipal  solid  waste  stream  by  generating  sector.    Note  that  paper  is  being 
disposed of in the highest quantities from both generating sectors. Glass shows up in 
the second highest quantity in the residential waste stream while metal is the second 
highest in the commercial waste stream.

This  section  of  the  report  presents  the  results  for  the  Georgia  Mountains  Regional 
Development Center, which includes Banks, Dawson, Forsyth, Franklin, Habersham, 
Hall, Hart, Lumpkin, Raburn, Stephens, Towns, Union, and White counties.  

In order to develop composition estimates for this RDC, field sampling was performed 
at the Oak Grove Landfill in Winder, Georgia.

Figure F-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of the RDC’s waste that are estimated 
to  be  disposed  in  the  State’s  landfills  (based  on  2003  EPD  facility  reports).    In 
absolute terms, over 168,000 tons of paper and over 95,000 tons of organics were the 
highest tons of material disposed in the RDC during 2003-2004.

 Figure  F-4  focuses  on  the  tons  of  commonly  recycled  materials  that  were  disposed.  
Overall,  paper  was  found  to  be  disposed  in  significant  quantities  in  the  Georgia 
Mountains RDC. Over 26 percent of all disposed materials in the RDC are commonly 
recycled  paper.  Recyclable  metals,  glass  and  plastics  were  found  at  relatively  lower 
disposal rates – four percent, three percent and two percent respectively.

 Figure  F-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Georgia  Mountains  RDC’s  disposed  waste  stream.    Across  the  RDC,  nonrecyclable 
paper  makes  up  the  largest  fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  12.7  percent,  followed  by 
corrugated  cardboard  (11.6  percent),  film  plastic  (7.8  percent)  and  food  waste 
(7.1 percent).  Wood from construction and demolition debris makes up 5.4 percent of 
the  waste  stream  while  newspaper  makes  up  4.6  percent,  fines  make  up  4.3  percent 
and office paper makes up 4.0 percent of the waste stream.  No other materials make 
up more than 4.0 percent of the RDC-wide waste stream.  The top ten most prevalent 
materials make up 64.5 percent of the disposed waste stream.

Figure  F-7  shows  the  top  10  most  prevalent  materials  in  Georgia  Mountains  RDC’s 
Commercial  Waste.    Nonrecyclable  paper  is  disposed  in  the  highest  quantity,  with 
corrugated  cardboard  and  miscellaneous  organics  as  the  second  and  third  highest 
disposed items respectively.  Note that in the commercial MSW generating stream no 
construction and demolition debris appear within the top ten most prevalent materials.

Figure G-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of the RDC’s waste that are estimated 
to  be  disposed  in  the  State’s  landfills  (based  on  2003  EPD  facility  reports).    In 
absolute terms, nearly 44,000 tons of paper and over 41,000 tons of organics were the 
highest tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

 Figure G-4 focuses on the tons of commonly recycled materials that were disposed.  
Overall,  paper  was  found  to  be  disposed  in  significant  quantities  in  Georgia.  More 
than  17  percent  of  all  disposed  materials  are  commonly  recycled  papers.  Recyclable 
metals, glass and plastics were found at relatively lower disposal rates – six percent, 
three percent and three percent respectively.

 Figure  G-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Heart of Georgia  – Altamaha RDC’s disposed waste stream.  Across the RDC, food 
waste  makes  up  the  largest  fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  12.3  percent,  followed  by 
nonrecyclable paper (11.8 percent), corrugated cardboard (6.3 percent) and film plastic 
(6.1 percent).  Textiles make up 5.9 percent of the waste stream while miscellaneous 
rigid plastics, miscellaneous construction and demolition debris and non-construction 
and  demolition  wood  make  up  4.5  percent,  4.4  percent  and  4.3  percent  respectively.  
No  other  materials  make  up  more  than  4.0  percent  of  the  RDC-wide  waste  stream.  
The  top  ten  most  prevalent  materials  make  up  62.3  percent  of  the  disposed  waste 
stream.

Figure  G-7  shows  the  top  10  most  prevalent  materials  in  the  Heart  of  Georgia  – 
Altamaha  RDC  Residential  Waste.    Food  waste  is  disposed  in  the  highest  quantity, 
with  other  paper  (non-recyclable)  and  film  plastic  as  the  second  and  third  highest 
disposed items respectively.  When comparing the residential generating sector to the 
commercial  and  transfer  trailer  generating  sectors  (Figures  G-8  and  G-9)  ,  the  latter 
show higher amounts of non-paper materials.

Figures  G-10  compares  the  amount  of  commonly  recycled  materials  disposed  in  the 
RDC’s  municipal  solid  waste  stream  by  generating  sector.    Note  that  paper  is  being 
disposed  of  in  the  highest  quantities  from  all  three  generating  sectors.  Metal  is  the 
second  highest  item  disposed  in  the  commercial  and  transfer  trailer  sectors,  but 
appears slightly less than glass in the residential waste stream.

This section of the report presents the results for the Lower Chattahoochee Regional 
Development  Center,  which  includes  Chattahoochee,  Clay,  Harris,  Muscogee, 
Quitman, Randolph, Stewart, and Talbot counties. 

In order to develop composition estimates for this RDC, field sampling was performed 
at two waste processing and disposal facilities: 

(cid:132)  Pine Grove Landfill in Columbus, Georgia; and 

(cid:132)  Columbus, Georgia Transfer Station.

Figure H-2 presents the aggregate composition of major material groups in the Lower 
Chattahoochee  RDC’s  disposed  municipal  solid  waste  stream.  As  shown,  paper  and 
organics make up the largest fractions of the waste stream, followed by plastics.  C&D 
debris and metals made up the fourth and fifth largest fractions of the waste stream, 
with glass and inorganics making up the smallest portion of the waste stream.

Figure H-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of the RDC’s waste that are estimated 
to  be  disposed  in  the  State’s  landfills  (based  on  2003  EPD  facility  reports).    In 
absolute terms, over 57,000 tons of paper and over 42,000 tons of organics were the 
highest tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

 Figure H-4 focuses on the tons of commonly recycled materials that were disposed.  
Overall,  paper  was  found  to  be  disposed  in  significant  quantities  in  Lower 
Chattahoochee.  Over  25  percent  of  all  materials  disposed  are  made  from  commonly 
recycled  paper.  Recyclable  metals,  glass  and  plastics  were  found  at  relatively  lower 
disposal rates – five percent, three percent and two percent respectively.

 Figure  H-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Lower  Chattahoochee  RDC’s  disposed  waste  stream.    Across  the  RDC,  food  waste 
makes  up  the  largest  fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  13.8  percent,  followed  by 
corrugated  cardboard  (11.6  percent),  nonrecyclable  paper  (10.5  percent)  and  film 
plastic (6.0 percent).  Newspaper, construction and demolition wood, and yard waste 
each make up 4.4 percent of the waste stream while miscellaneous rigid plastics make 
up 4.3 percent.  No other materials make up more than 4.0 percent of the RDC-wide 
waste  stream.    The  top  ten  most  prevalent  materials  make  up  67.2  percent  of  the 
disposed waste stream.

disposed  items  respectively.    Note  that  in  the  residential  MSW  generating  stream 
wood  and  office  paper  are  not  seen  within  the  top  ten  materials.    However,  when 
comparing  the  residential  generating  sector  to  the  commercial  generating  sector 
(Figure H-8), the latter shows wood and office paper making up more than 13 percent 
of the commercial waste stream.

Figure  H-9  compares  the  amount  of  commonly  recycled  materials  disposed  in  the 
RDC’s  municipal  solid  waste  stream  by  generating  sector.    Note  that  paper  is  being 
disposed of in the highest quantities from both generating sectors. Metal is the second 
highest item disposed – tied with glass in the residential sector.

Figure  I-2  presents  the  aggregate  composition  of  major  material  groups  in  the 
McIntosh Trail RDC’s disposed municipal solid waste stream. As shown, organics and 
paper make up the largest fractions of the waste stream, followed by plastics.  Metals 
and inorganics made up the next largest fraction of the waste stream at eight percent 
each. Construction and demolition debris and glass make up the smallest portion of the 
waste stream.

Figure I-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of RDC’s waste that are estimated to be 
disposed  in  the  State’s  landfills  (based  on  2003  EPD  facility  reports).    In  absolute 
terms, over 45,000 tons of paper and nearly 54,000 tons of organics were the highest 
tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

 Figure  I-4  focuses  on  the  tons  of  commonly  recycled  materials  that  were  disposed.  
Overall, paper was found to be disposed in significant quantities in Georgia. Over 17 
percent  of  all  materials  disposed  were  made  from  commonly  recycled  paper. 
Recyclable  metals,  glass  and  plastics  were  found  at  relatively  lower  disposal  rates  – 
eight percent, four percent and two percent respectively.

 Figure  I-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
McIntosh Trail RDC’s disposed waste stream.  Across the RDC, corrugated cardboard 
makes up  the largest fraction of disposed waste at 10.1 percent, followed by textiles 
(9.2  percent),  food  waste  (8.7  percent)  and  nonrecyclable  paper  (7.7  percent).    Non-
construction  and  demolition  wood  makes  up  7.5  percent  of  the  waste  stream  while 
miscellaneous rigid plastics, miscellaneous electronics, film plastic and ferrous metals 
make up 5.4 percent, 4.8 percent, 4.6 percent and 4.3 percent respectively.  No other 
materials make up more than 4.0 percent of the RDC-wide waste stream.  The top ten 
most prevalent materials make up 65.4 percent of the RDC’s disposed waste stream.

Figure  I-7  shows  the  top  10  most  prevalent  materials  in  the  McIntosh  Trail  RDC’s 
Residential  Waste.    Food  waste  is  disposed  in  the  highest  quantity,  with  other  paper 
(non-recyclable)  and  miscellaneous  electronics  as  the  second  and  third  highest 
disposed  items  respectively.    Note  that  in  the  residential  MSW  generating  stream 
corrugated cardboard places fifth highest in materials disposed but is the highest in the 
commercial generating sector (Figure I-8).

This  section  of  the  report  presents  the  results  for  the  Middle  Georgia  Regional 
Development  Center,  which  includes  Baldwin,  Bibb,  Crawford,  Houston,  Jones, 
Monroe, Peach, Twiggs, and Wilkinson counties. 

In order to develop composition estimates for this RDC, field sampling was performed 
at the Houston County Landfill in Kathleen, Georgia.

Figure J-2 presents the aggregate composition of major material groups in the Middle 
Georgia RDC’s disposed municipal solid waste stream. As shown, paper and organics 
make up the largest fractions of the waste stream, followed by plastics.  C&D debris 
and inorganics made up the fourth and fifth largest fractions of the waste stream, with 
metal and glass making up the smallest portion of the waste stream.

Figure J-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of RDC’s waste that are estimated to 
be disposed in the State’s landfills (based on 2003 EPD facility reports).  In absolute 
terms,  nearly  145,000  tons  of  paper  and  over  110,000  tons  of  organics  were  the 
highest tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

Figure  J-4  focuses  on  the  tons  of  commonly  recycled  materials  that  were  disposed.  
Overall, paper was found to be disposed in significant quantities in the RDC. Over 24 
percent of all materials disposed in the RDC are made from commonly recycled paper. 
Recyclable  metals,  plastics  and  glass  were  found  at  relatively  lower  disposal  rates  – 
five percent, two percent and two percent respectively.

Figure  J-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Middle  Georgia  RDC’s  disposed  waste  stream.    Across  the  RDC,  corrugated 
cardboard makes up the largest fraction of disposed waste at 13.8 percent, followed by 
food  waste  (11.3  percent),  nonrecyclable  paper  (8.3  percent)  and  film  plastic 
(7.8 percent).    Miscellaneous  rigid  plastics  make  up  5.4  percent  of  the  waste  stream 
while  newspaper,  yard  waste  and  miscellaneous  electronics  make  up  5.3 percent, 
5.0 percent and 4.3 percent respectively.  No other materials make up more than 4.0 
percent of the RDC-wide waste stream.  The top ten most prevalent materials make up 
67.8 percent of the disposed waste stream.

Figure  J-9  compares  the  amount  of  commonly  recycled  materials  disposed  in  the 
municipal solid waste stream by generating sector.  Note that paper is being disposed 
of  in  the  highest  quantities  from  both  generating  sectors  with  metal  as  the  second 
highest item disposed.  This suggests that the State can target programs for additional 
diversion opportunities for paper and metal in all three generating sectors.

Figure  K-2  presents  the  aggregate  composition  of  major  material  groups  in  the 
Northeast  Georgia  RDC’s  disposed  municipal  solid  waste  stream.  As  shown,  paper 
and organics make up the largest fractions of the waste stream, followed by plastics.  
Metals  and  glass  made  up  the  fourth  and  fifth  largest  fractions  of  the  waste  stream, 
with inorganics and construction and demolition debris making up he smallest portion 
of the waste stream.

Figure K-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of the RDC’s waste that are estimated 
to  be  disposed  in  the  State’s  landfills  (based  on  2003  EPD  facility  reports).    In 
absolute terms, over 125,000 tons of paper and over 82,000 tons of organics were the 
highest tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

Figure  K-4  focuses  on  the  tons  of  commonly  recycled  materials  that  were  disposed.  
Overall, paper was found to be disposed in significant quantities in Northeast Georgia. 
Over  22 percent  of  all  disposed  materials  are  made  from  commonly  recycled  paper. 
Recyclable  metals,  glass  and  plastics  were  found  at  relatively  lower  disposal  rates  – 
six percent, five percent and three percent respectively.

Figure  K-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Northeast  Georgia  RDC’s  disposed  waste  stream.    Across  the  RDC,  nonrecyclable 
paper  makes  up  the  largest  fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  14.2  percent,  followed  by 
food  waste  (13.0  percent),  corrugated  cardboard  (9.0  percent)  and  film  plastic 
(7.3 percent).    Newspaper  makes  up  4.9  percent  of  the  waste  stream  while 
miscellaneous rigid plastics make up 4.5 percent.  No other materials make up more 
than 4.0 percent of the RDC-wide waste stream.  The top ten most prevalent materials 
make up 67.4 percent of the disposed waste stream.

Figure  K-7  shows  the  top  10  most  prevalent  materials  in  Northeast  Georgia  RDC’s 
Residential  Waste.    Food  waste  is  disposed  in  the  highest  quantity,  with  other  paper 
(non-recyclable)  and  film  plastic  as  the  second  and  third  highest  disposed  items 
respectively.    Note  that  in  the  residential  MSW  generating  stream  corrugated 
cardboard places forth highest in materials disposed.  However, when comparing the 
residential generating sector to the commercial and transfer trailer generating sectors 
(Figures  K-8  and  K-9),  the  latter  show  corrugated  cardboard  disposed  in  higher 
quantities,  with  food  waste  placing  third  in  the  commercial  sector  and  second  in  the 
transfer trailer sector.

Figure  K-10  compares  the  amount  of  commonly  recycled  disposed  in  the  municipal 
solid waste stream by generating sector.  Note that paper is being disposed of in the 
highest quantities from all three generating sectors, with metal as the second highest 
item disposed.

This  section  of  the  report  presents  the  results  for  the  South  Georgia  Regional 
Development  Center,  which includes  Ben Hill, Brooks, Cook, Echols, Irwin, Lanier, 
Lowndes, Tift, and Turner counties. 

In order to develop composition estimates for this RDC, field sampling was performed 
at the Pecan Row landfill in Valdosta, Georgia.

Figure L-2 presents the aggregate composition of major material groups in the South 
Georgia RDC’s disposed municipal solid waste stream. As shown, paper and organics 
make  up  the  largest  fractions  of  the  waste  stream,  followed  by  plastics.    C&D  and 
metals  made  up  the  fourth  and  fifth  largest  fractions  of  the  waste  stream,  with  glass 
and inorganics making up the smallest portion of the waste stream.

Figure L-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of the RDC’s waste that are estimated 
to  be  disposed  in  the  State’s  landfills  (based  on  2003  EPD  facility  reports).    In 
absolute terms, more than 48,000 tons of paper and over 41,000 tons of organics were 
the highest tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

Figure  L-4  focuses  on  the  tons  of  commonly  recycled  materials  that  were  disposed.  
Overall,  paper  was  found  to  be  disposed  in  significant  quantities  in  South  Georgia. 
More than 20 percent of all materials disposed in the RDC are made from commonly 
recycled  paper.  Recyclable  metals,  glass  and  plastics  were  found  at  relatively  lower 
disposal rates – six percent, five percent and three percent respectively.

Figure  L-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
South Georgia RDC’s disposed waste stream.  Across the RDC, food waste makes up 
the  largest  fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  13.7  percent,  followed  by  film  plastic 
(8.8  percent)  and  corrugated  cardboard 
(9.1 percent),  nonrecyclable  paper 
(8.7 percent).  Non-construction wood makes up 4.5 percent of the waste stream.  No 
other materials make up more than 4.0 percent of the RDC-wide waste stream.  The 
top ten most prevalent materials make up 61.7 percent of the disposed waste stream.

Figure  L-7  shows  the  top  10  most  prevalent  materials  in  the  South  Georgia  RDC’s 
Residential  Waste.    Food  waste  is  disposed  in  the  highest  quantity,  with  other  paper 
(non-recyclable)  and  film  plastic  as  the  second  and  third  highest  disposed  items 
respectively.    Note  that  in  the  residential  MSW  generating  stream  corrugated 
cardboard places tenth highest in materials disposed.  However, when comparing the 
residential generating sector to the commercial and transfer trailer generating sectors 
(Figures  L-8  and  L-9),  the  latter  show  corrugated  cardboard  disposed  in  the  highest 
quantity,  with  food  waste  placing  second  both  the  commercial  and  transfer  trailer 
sectors.

Figure  L-10  compares  the  amount  of  commonly  recycled  materials  disposed  in  the 
RDC’s  municipal  solid  waste  stream  by  generating  sector.    Note  that  paper  is  being 
disposed  of  in  the  highest  quantities  from  all  three  generating  sectors,  with  metal  as 
the second highest item disposed.

Figure  M-2  presents  the  aggregate  composition  of  major  material  groups  in  the 
Southeast  Georgia  RDC’s  disposed  municipal  solid  waste  stream.  As  shown,  paper 
and organics make up the largest fractions of the waste stream, followed by plastics.  
Metals  and  C&D  made  up  the  fourth  and  fifth  largest  fractions  of  the  waste  stream, 
with inorganics and glass making up the smallest portion of the waste stream.

Figure M-3 shows a bar graph of the actual tons of Southeast Georgia RDC’s waste 
that are estimated to be disposed in the State’s landfills (based on 2003 EPD facility 
reports).    In  absolute  terms,  nearly  59,000  tons  of  paper  and  nearly  55,000  tons  of 
organics were the highest tons of material disposed in 2003-2004.

Figure M-4 focuses on the tons of commonly recycled materials that were disposed.  
Overall, paper was found to be disposed in significant quantities in the RDC. Nearly 
21 percent  of  all  materials  disposed  are  made  from  commonly  recycled  paper. 
Recyclable  metals,  glass  and  plastics  were  found  at  relatively  lower  disposal  rates  – 
five percent, three percent and three percent respectively.

Figure  M-5  shows  the  top  ten  individual  materials  that  were  most  prevalent  in  the 
Southeast Georgia RDC’s disposed waste stream.  Across the RDC, food waste makes 
up  the  largest  fraction  of  disposed  waste  at  13.6  percent,  followed  by  nonrecyclable 
paper  (11.8  percent),  corrugated  cardboard  (8.5  percent)  and  textiles  (6.6  percent).  
Film  plastic  makes  up  5.8  percent  of  the  waste  stream  while  miscellaneous  rigid 
plastics,  diaper,  office  paper  and  newspapers  make  up  4.4  percent,  4.3  percent, 
4.2 percent and 4.0 percent respectively.  No other materials make up more than 4.0 
percent of the RDC-wide waste stream.  The top ten most prevalent materials make up 
66.5 percent of the disposed waste stream.

Figure  M-7  shows  the  top  10  most  prevalent  materials  in  the  Southeast  Georgia 
RDC’s Residential Waste.  Food waste is disposed in the highest quantity, with other 
paper  (non-recyclable)  and  textiles  as  the  second  and  third  highest  disposed  items 
respectively.  The most noticeable variance between the sectors is that commercial and 
transfer sectors (Figures M-8 and M-9) have much more high grade office paper than 
the residential sector in this RDC. Additionally, paperboard is much more common in 
the residential sector than in the commercial and transfer trailer sectors.

Figures M-10 compares  the amount  of  commonly  recycled materials disposed in the 
municipal solid waste stream by generating sector.  Note that paper is being disposed 
of in the highest quantities from all three generating sectors, with metal as the second 
highest item disposed in residential and commercial and just slightly less than glass in 
the transfer trailer sector.
