Kathryn Garcia
Commissioner

New York City,  
Department of Sanitation

Fellow New Yorkers,

Together, we are working toward our goal of 
sending zero waste to landfills by 2030. But 
we cannot achieve this goal without regularly 
measuring and tracking our progress. 

This 2017 Waste Characterization Study tells  
us that our efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle 
our waste are working. The average New York 
City household throws away less and recycles 
more today than five years ago. Electronic  
waste, which contains potentially hazardous 
metals, now makes up just 0.3 percent of what 
New Yorkers throw away, reflecting growing 
participation in e-waste recycling programs.

But this report also shows us that we have 
incredible opportunities to develop and grow 
programs to achieve even more. Organic waste, 
including food scraps, food-soiled paper and 
yard waste, now makes up 34 percent of our 
waste stream. When source-separated, these 
products can be composted into a nutrient-rich 
soil amendment or turned into clean, renewable 
energy. To capture this material, we will expand 
NYC Organics to serve all New Yorkers with either 
curbside collection or convenient neighborhood 
drop-off sites by the end of 2018.

This report, the result of thousands of hours of 
sorting and weighing more than 800 samples, 
also highlights important changes in consumer 
behavior and what we buy and use every day.  
For example, the average household discards  
80 percent less newspaper and 150 percent  
more cardboard than in 2005.

I encourage you to review not only this report 
but also the accompanying data tables and field 
guide, both available at nyc.gov/wastestudy. 

Thank you for your partnership as we work 
together to achieve our zero waste goals.

II. Highlights

• New Yorkers are producing less waste at home than ever before—

and 68% of what we do throw away belongs in a curbside recycling or
organics bin (see page 12).

• Organics —including food scraps, food-soiled paper, and yard waste—is the
largest and still growing category of waste (34% of total waste), representing
the biggest opportunity for New Yorkers to divert waste from landfills.

• After New York State implemented an electronic waste (e-waste) disposal

ban, e-waste has declined by 60% (see page 32).

• New Yorkers are best at recycling cardboard (79% capture rate) and most
often forget to recycle aluminum (15% capture rate) (see pages 20, 22).

• Cartons and aseptic boxes—including milk and juice cartons—are the
most commonly misplaced recyclable item, often being placed in the
Paper recycling instead of in commingled metal, glass, plastic and carton
recycling (“MGP”) (see page 25).

III.  Introduction

The New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) 
conducted the 2017 NYC Residential, School, and  
NYCHA Waste Characterization Study (2017 Study) over 
three seasons: spring, summer and fall in calendar year 2017.  
This study fulfills DSNY’s requirements under Local Law 40  
of 2010 and builds on decades of research and analysis into 
the evolving composition of our waste stream. 

History of Waste Characterization Studies in NYC

Cities conduct periodic waste characterization studies to assess changes in the composition 

of discarded material and to inform development of waste management programs and 

services like recycling, composting, and reuse. These studies involve collecting samples of 

waste and sorting those samples into multiple material categories to produce statistically 

representative and generalizable information about what is in a city’s waste stream and in 

what quantities. 

Waste characterization studies not only help to measure the success of diversion programs, 

such as recycling and composting, they also provide broader insight into the evolving 

waste stream by documenting consumer consumption patterns and the design of products 

being discarded, which influence what can and cannot be diverted. Waste characterization 

studies can also, in part, reveal the success of waste management policies and programs by 

measuring the reduction of targeted components of the waste stream. 

For example, certain electronic waste is banned from collection and disposal in New York 
State. In NYC, residents are directed to recycle these electronics through alternative 

programs such as ecycleNYC and e-waste drop-off events run by DSNY. Waste 

characterization studies can provide insight into the effectiveness of these programs to 

reduce the target material from the Refuse stream.

DSNY has conducted waste characterization studies in NYC in 1990, 2005, and 2013. Each 

of these studies share a similar fundamental methodology of waste sampling and sorting, 

but also include varying targeted analyses to characterize particular components of the 

waste stream or to highlight variations in composition across geographic areas, sectors, or 

socioeconomic categories. 

4  |  2017 NYC Residential, School, and NYCHA Waste Characterization Study

The 2005 Study examined residential curbside collections of commingled paper and 

cardboard recycling (“Paper”); MGP; and trash (“Refuse”) that provided statistical results 

by housing density and income levels throughout the City. The 2005 Study also included a 

characterization of the contents of street litter baskets. 

The 2013 Study surveyed residential curbside Paper, MGP and Refuse collections  

providing statistical results by borough and for the City as a whole, but not by housing 

density and income levels. The 2013 Study also included a detailed characterization of 

plastics and of food and beverage containers being discarded. 

The 2017 Study followed the same method for residential curbside collections as the 2013 

Study, with the addition of residential curbside collections of organic waste (“Organics”), 

the City’s new service to recycle food scraps, food-soiled paper and yard waste. The 2017 

Study also characterized collections from both New York City public schools and New 

York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) buildings to create a baseline citywide view of waste 

generation from those sources. The 2017 study included a detailed analysis of plastics using 

the same method as the 2013 Study. It also includes a more detailed characterization of 

certain paper products. 

The 2013 and 2017 Studies were conducted in partnership with DSNY’s recycling vendor, 

Sims Municipal Recycling and were executed by the consultant Mid-Atlantic Solid Waste 

Consultants (MSW Consultants). 

The full results of the 2005, 2013, and 2017 studies are available at nyc.gov/wastestudy.

IV. Method

The 2017 Study characterized three sources of DSNY 
collections that cover the vast majority of the waste handled 
by DSNY: Residential, Schools, and NYCHA. The Study’s 
method, summarized below, is documented in detail in the 
field manual available at nyc.gov/wastestudy.

Residential: 
The 2017 Study sought to generally replicate the methodology of 

the 2013 Study for residential collections. This report documents the 

changes in the composition of the residential waste stream over time 

and how much of that material is being properly recycled or improperly 

discarded in Refuse. The residential results are statistically significant 

citywide and by borough.

The residential characterization included four residential curbside 

collection streams—Refuse, Paper, MGP, and Organics. DSNY collects 

from residential properties of all sizes, ranging from single family homes 

to town houses and small walk-up style buildings to large high rise 

apartment buildings. Residential curbside collections also serve a small 

number of institutional and agency customers. 

Residential curbside collections 
make up the large majority of 
material that DSNY manages. 
They have been the primary 
focus of waste characterization 
studies over the years, through 
which we have developed a 
robust set of data to compare 
how the NYC waste stream has 
evolved over time.

Schools: 
The 2017 Study sought to re-establish, for the first time since 1990, a citywide baseline of the 

composition of waste generated by schools. This report provides a waste profile for schools 

and compares it to residential collections. The school results are statistically significant citywide.

The school characterization included Refuse, Paper and MGP streams collected on 

dedicated school collection routes. These routes are predominantly comprised of public 

schools, although they also include a small number of private and charter schools. Schools 

on these routes reflect the variety of school sizes and types in the city, and the data gathered 

serve to provide a generalizable citywide baseline understanding of waste composition 

for NYC schools as a whole. For the purposes of this Study, DSNY did not characterize 

Organics separated for diversion. Rather, organic waste is included in the Refuse stream.

NYCHA: 
The 2017 Study sought to establish a citywide baseline of the composition of waste 

generated by New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) public housing developments and 

collected by DSNY. This report provides a waste profile for NYCHA properties and identifies 

the potential to divert recyclables. The NYCHA results are statistically significant citywide.

6  |  2017 NYC Residential, School, and NYCHA Waste Characterization Study

The NYCHA characterization focused sample collection from the large compacting 

containers used by DSNY to collect Refuse at NYCHA’s large campus-style developments. 

The vast majority of NYCHA waste is generated at the large campus-style developments 

and collected in these containers, and this material was used to provide a generalizable 

citywide baseline understanding of waste composition for NYCHA residents. A minority of 

NYCHA Refuse and a small amount of Paper and MGP recyclables are collected along with 

neighborhood residential curbside collections.

Bulky waste generated by schools and NYCHA. Large NYCHA 
developments and some schools arrange for separate collection 
of large or bulky waste items. Such separate bulk collections were 
not assessed in the 2017 Study. For this reason, for both NYCHA 
and schools, we expect that the results presented here under-
represent large or bulky discards that receive alternative handling 
outside of the standard curbside collections performed by DSNY.

Other DSNY Collections:
The 2017 Study did not characterize litter basket collections, street cleaning collections from 

mechanical brooms, or other seasonal, or specialized collection services performed by DSNY.

Changes to DSNY Waste Management Strategy

Two significant changes to DSNY’s waste management strategy occurred between  

2013 and 2017, which affected the 2017 Study methodology: the expansion of the MGP 

recycling program to include all rigid plastics and the expansion of residential curbside 

Organics collection service.

All Rigid Plastics: At the time of the 2005 and 2013 studies, the only plastics designated 
for recycling were plastic bottles and jugs. In late 2013 with the completion of the City’s 

new recycling processing facility in Brooklyn, the City designated all other non-bottle 

rigid plastics, including yogurt containers, takeout containers, and bulky rigid plastics, as 

recyclable. Before that, including during the period when DSNY conducted the 2013 Study, 

these items were considered contamination in the MGP collections. At the time of the 2017 

Study, the expanded plastics recycling program had been in place for three and a half years, 

allowing us to document the impact on diversion.

Organics Collection: In 2013, the City began a pilot curbside Organics collection program 
serving approximately 3,500 households on Staten Island. Since that time, the program 

has grown significantly. By the end of 2018, NYC Organics will serve all New Yorkers 

through curbside collection or convenient neighborhood drop-off sites. The 2017 Study 

characterized Organics collections from those neighborhoods with collection service at the 

time the study was conducted.

Sampling methods 
followed industry 
standards to ensure 
that results reflected 
waste composition 
accurately.

Sampling

The study team collected statistically representative samples of:

•  Residential curbside collections of four streams—Refuse, Paper, MGP, and Organics— 

in all five boroughs across three seasons. 

•  School truck collections (without separate Organics collection service) of three streams—

Refuse, Paper and MGP—across three seasons. 

•  NYCHA compacting container collections of Refuse in all five boroughs across one season.

Samples were selected randomly from trucks identified by DSNY collection route and 

tonnage data to reach a 90 percent confidence of statistical significance. The number of 

samples of each collection type and material stream reflected the underlying variability in 

the waste. The higher sampling frequency for residential collections allowed for statistical 

significance at the borough level, while school and NYCHA collections are statistically 

significant only at the citywide level.

Based on standard industry practice, the study team collected 100 pounds of material per 

sample for MGP, Paper and Organics; and 200 pounds per sample for Refuse. 

Sorting Stations

Sorting

Samples were hand sorted by the study team into 70 main sort categories. In addition,  

sub-sorting of an additional 172 categories was conducted to get a more detailed 

understanding of the wide variety of plastic products in the waste stream, as well as a  

sub-set of Paper products including paper cups, paper shopping bags, shredded paper, 

and compostable paper. All main and sub-sort categories along with product examples  

are listed in the Appendix.

All samples, regardless of the source or stream, were fully sorted into the same set of 

categories. This consistent approach allowed us to calculate the composition not only 

of each stream, but also the sum total of all waste from each source.

How the Results Are Presented

The composition of the collection source or material stream is presented in relative terms  

as the percentage of the waste stream. As one material increases as a percentage of waste, 

others shrink proportionately.

Results are also presented in absolute terms as the quantity by weight of each material type. 

The quantity of each material is calculated by applying the percent composition to the total 

quantity of DSNY collections for fiscal year 2017 (July 2016 – June 2017).

For the residential curbside collections, the results also compare the 2017 Study to the 

two prior studies. The 2017, 2013 and 2005 studies are comparable across a total of 65 

material groups. In addition, we also normalize the results on a per household basis to 

account for increases in New York City’s population since the 2005 Study.

The term “Aggregate Discards” is used in the results section to mean overall waste, or the 

sum total of all material streams. For residential collections, Aggregate Discards are the 

sum total of Refuse, MGP, Paper and Organics streams combined. For School Collections, 

Aggregate Discards are the sum total of Refuse, MGP and Paper streams combined. For 

NYCHA, only the Refuse stream was studied.

Residential curbside collections are by far the greatest quantity of material that 
DSNY manages. The graphs and tables in this section show the 2017 citywide 
results for residential collections and present comparisons to the 2013 and 2005 
Studies to illustrate how NYC’s waste has changed over time. The full citywide

The 2017 Study tells us that over a third of everything New Yorkers discard, some 34% 

of Aggregate Discards, consists of NYC-designated Paper and MGP recyclables. Stated 

another way, if every New Yorker recycled every scrap of Paper and MGP perfectly, the 

recycling or diversion rate would be 34%. 

Another 34% of all discards is made up of organic materials suitable for composting and 

targeted by NYC’s Organics collection service. If every New Yorker recycled every bit of 

food scraps, yard waste and compostable paper, the combined diversion rate from Paper, 

MGP and Organics recycling would be 68%.

About 9% of residential waste consists of materials that have established non-curbside 

programs to divert them from landfills. For example, a little over 6% consists of textiles 

(clothing, linens, shoes, accessories) suitable for donation or recycling. Electronics and 

other harmful household products, such as paint, pesticides, and mercury devices, are a 

small share of discards (not even 1%), but have a disproportionate environmental impact. 

New York State law has banned certain electronics and harmful household products from 

disposal. Plastic shopping bags (nearly 2%) are covered under a New York State retailer 

recycling law and are targeted for waste reduction legislation. 

The remaining quarter of residential waste (23%) consists of “Other” items, for which  

there are no or very limited options for beneficial use at this time, including small scale 

building material scrap (construction and demolition debris), furniture and household  

wood products, treated wood and lumber, carpeting, various plastic film, flexible and  

foam products, multi-material items, disposable diapers, and animal by-products.

Changes in NYC’s Waste Profile

The total quantity of waste generated in NYC continues to decline. In 2005,  
residential curbside collections totaled almost 3.5 million tons per year, 2.8 million of  

which were disposed as Refuse. In 2017, residential collections were down to less than  

3.1 million tons per year, with 2.5 million tons disposed as Refuse. This all took place as  

the NYC population grew from 8.2 to over 8.5 million inhabitants (from 3 million households 

to 3.1 million households). 

On a per household basis, the average NYC household in 2017 discarded fewer than 

1,990 pounds per year of Aggregate Discards, down from 2,000 pounds in 2013, and 

nearly 2,280 pounds per year in 2005. As illustrated below this decline is largely due to an 

ongoing decline in Refuse. The quantity of Paper and MGP recycled both rebounded in 

2017. The quantity of Organics recycled cannot yet be compared over time as 2017 is the 

first year characterizing this stream, and it is not yet a citywide program.

The decline in overall waste generated by New Yorkers may be due 
to changes in consumption patterns, such as the decline in print 
newspaper sales, and to the evolution in product design to favor more 
lightweight packaging. 

It also has to do with economic trends that affect consumption, and other external  

factors impacting what ends up in DSNY trucks. For example, cans and bottles,  

which carry a five-cent redeemable deposit, may be set out by residents but taken  

by scavengers before they can be collected by DSNY.

When viewed by material type on a per household basis, not all types of waste  

have declined. More food scraps and food-soiled paper suitable for composting were 

discarded in 2017 both on a per household basis and as a relative share of overall waste 

than in 2013. Clean recyclable paper and cardboard continued to shrink over all three 

studies. Households generated more non-bottle rigid plastic waste than in prior years,  

and the quantity of harmful household products and textiles continued to grow.

MGP recyclables dipped between 2005 and 2013, and rebounded in 2017 after the 

addition of non-bottle rigid plastics to the MGP recycling program.

Textiles increased by a third between 2005 and 2013 and stayed steady in 2017.  

Between 2005 and 2017, plastic shopping bags as well as construction and demolition 

debris, declined slightly. Electronic waste, after growing between 2005 and 2013, has 

sharply declined.

Complex economic 
factors and trends in 
consumer product 
design can affect 
consumption habits, 
which in turn can 
affect recycling and 
disposal rates.

Recycling Achievement

The nature of what New Yorkers, and Americans, discard is changing. Our recycling 

achievements are affected by the composition of the products produced, consumed and 

discarded—both recyclable and non-recyclable—and the level of participation in recycling. 

Many products that used to be made from recyclable materials are now made from multi-

layered flexible packaging not accepted for recycling by DSNY. We read less printed matter, 

which may account for the decline in recyclable Paper. At the same time, online shopping 

and home delivery grows, which means we generate more recyclable corrugated cardboard.

Multiple metrics help us understand the City’s recycling achievements in residential 

collections. The weight of Paper and MGP collected in recycling trucks identifies absolute 

quantities recycled. The “capture rate” is the percentage of all Paper and MGP that is 

properly separated for recycling as opposed to discarded as Refuse. Capture rates 

identify the latent potential to recycle more. Finally, contamination rates measure unwanted 

materials in curbside recycling. Today’s recycling facilities are designed to recognize and 

sort recyclables from contamination using mechanical and manual methods. They do so 

with accuracy and efficiency. However, sorting and disposing of contaminants adds to the 

cost of recycling, and any contamination diminishes the quality of recovered recyclables.

Paper capture rates
While the total amount of Paper discarded has continued to decline, the weight of Paper 

captured in recycling collections increased between 2013 and 2017. The capture rate of 

recyclable paper and cardboard has increased nearly four and a half percentage points 

between 2013 and 2017.

The overall capture rate of recyclable paper has increased nearly 
four and a half percentage points between 2013 and 2017.

MGP capture rates
Total MGP collected in recycling collections declined between 2005 and 2013, but more 

than rebounded in 2017 after the expansion of the program to include non-bottle rigid 

plastics. In fact, 2017 marked the highest amount by weight of MGP recyclables collected 

in almost 15 years. 

The expansion of MGP recycling to include non-bottle rigid plastics after the conclusion of 

the 2013 Study changed what was targeted for recycling collections between study years. 

To allow for comparison, the table below splits MGP recyclables in three categories: rigid 

plastic bottles and jugs, non-bottle rigid plastics (which were considered contamination during 

the 2005 and 2013 studies), and other MGP items including metal, glass containers, cartons. 

These results show that the capture rate for non-bottle rigid plastics was 27.5% in 2017, 

still low compared to other designated MGP categories but 11 percentage points higher 

than the 2013 capture rate, when such products were considered contamination. This 

demonstrates the amount of time it takes for New Yorkers to change recycling behavior in 

response to changes in the recycling program and is consistent with past experience.

The capture rate for rigid plastic bottles and jugs remained at about 50%, and the rate for 

other MGP items increased by four percentage points between 2013 and 2017.

Results by Material Category

Paper and Cardboard
The most striking change in recyclable paper is the dramatic decline in newspaper,  

as consumers continue to move toward digital news sources. In 2005, the average New 

Yorker recycled over 100 pounds of newspaper. As of 2017, this total was down to less 

than 20 pounds. Other types of Paper are also declining, though not as markedly. High-

grade white office paper (printer paper and white envelopes), one of the originally targeted 

recyclables in NYC almost three decades ago, is the smallest fraction of recyclable  

paper in the residential waste stream.

The amount of corrugated cardboard has grown substantially from 2005, reflecting increasing 

consumer preference for home deliveries. Even as the total amount of corrugated cardboard 

has increased since 2005, the amount improperly disposed in Refuse has fallen. The capture 

rate for cardboard recycling is at an all-time high of 79%, over 90 pounds per household.

The most prevalent Paper category, mixed low-grade paper—which includes smooth 

cardboard, junk mail, magazines, and colored papers—was more likely to be improperly 

disposed by New Yorkers, with a capture rate of only 35 percent in 2017. However, the 

capture rate has improved by three percentage points since 2013.

Paper Recycling Contamination
Contamination in Paper recycling has increased over the three studies from 5.1% 

in 2005 to 8.9% in 2017, but remains quite low for a curbside recycling program.

MGP
Metal
Metal made up 4.6% of the overall waste stream in 2017. In recycling collections, metal,  

in particular, has shown a rebound since 2013. The capture rates for ferrous metal scrap, 

including appliances and large items (“other ferrous”), are higher than any other type of 

metal. Large items, such as metal filing cabinets or shelves, are usually placed out at the 

curb separately from bagged material, and so DSNY is more likely to find and collect these 

items in the recycling truck.

Metal, including iron, 
steel, aluminum, 
copper and brass, is 
an easily recyclable 
material with a great 
variety of end uses.

Note: Totals may not sum exactly due to rounding.

In 2013, commodity prices for ferrous scrap metal—including 
large metal items and metal appliances— were very high, driving 
the illegal scavenging of metal scrap items from curbside recycling 
set out by residents before they could be collected and weighed 
by DSNY. The scrap market is highly volatile, however, and by 
2017 metal prices had fallen with respect to 2013. More ferrous 
metal, as a result, was found in curbside collections, as opposed 
to being removed by the informal sector and taken to scrap metal 
dealers for sale.

NYC Department of Sanitation  |  21

Steel cans are recycled more consistently and at a higher rate than they were in 2013, 

though not as successfully as ferrous scrap metal. The overall quantity of steel cans 

discarded in both recycling and Refuse is declining, however. This may be due to a 

change of products formerly made from steel cans now manufactured using other forms 

of packaging. For example, many leading coffee brands have switched from steel cans to 

plastic containers or vacuum-packed bricks.

In 2017, as in the two previous study years, aluminum cans, foil and containers were found 
in Refuse in much larger quantities than in MGP recycling. The aluminum can—one of the 
iconic recyclable products—has a surprisingly low capture rate of 30%. This is likely due 
to the scavenging of cans bearing a 5 cent deposit. Deposit containers are disproportionately 

scavenged from clear-bagged recycling setouts in comparison to black-bagged Refuse 

setouts, leaving fewer cans in DSNY MGP recycling collections than Refuse collections.

Aluminum foil and containers have an even lower low capture rate of 15%. This may be 

due to the tendency of aluminum foil to be food-soiled when discarded.

Note: Totals may not sum exactly due to rounding.

Rigid plastics are designated as recyclable in NYC, but film, flexible  
or foam plastics are not. Rigid plastics are hard-sided plastic products 
that maintain their shape unlike film and flexible plastic items, like 
bags, tarps, wrappers, pouches and squeeze tubes, and foam 
plastics like protective packaging and food service foam products.

In 2017, more than three years since the recycling program expanded to include “all rigid 

plastics,” New Yorkers recycled about 30% of rigid plastic containers and packaging, and 

bulky rigid plastic items. As illustrated in the graphs below, however, rigid plastic items are 

a growing part of the residential waste stream, and represent a large untapped source of 

diversion. This growth in rigid plastic discards reflects an increase in consumer products and 

packaging made of rigid plastic as opposed to other materials, such as glass or metal.

Glass and Cartons
Glass containers comprise a little over 4% of Aggregate Discards. Glass has declined 

significantly in Refuse since 2005, but stayed consistent in MGP recycling. The capture 

rate of container glass has grown to 63%. The reduction in overall glass discards may 

reflect trends in product design—glass bottles are still preferred for liquor, beer and 

specialty soft drinks, but the use of glass containers is declining in food packaging  

due to their heavy weight, which drives up shipping costs.

Residents are 
commonly confused 
about why cartons 
and aseptic boxes, 
seemingly made of 
Paper, get recycled 
with metal, glass 
and plastic instead 
of Paper. These 
items are made of 
multiple layers of 
material and are 
three dimensional in 
shape, which makes 
the equipment at 
the MGP recycling 
facility more effective 
at sorting these items.

Note: Totals may not sum exactly due to rounding.

Characterizing glass waste is complicated by the way glass behaves during curbside 

collections. As shown in the graphs below, mixed cullet is a glass category that represents 

broken glass containers of all colors. Glass collected in Refuse trucks tends to break 

less than when it is collected in MGP recycling trucks. Refuse has a high proportion of 

food and soft paper that acts as a cushion, in contrast with the rigid plastic and metal in 

MGP recycling. Therefore, glass sorted from Refuse samples has a higher proportion of 

intact containers and a lower proportion of mixed cullet than does glass sorted from MGP 

samples. For this reason, we also present here the total quantity of glass containers in MGP 

and Refuse, which is more comparable than the more detailed glass container categories.

Milk and juice cartons and aseptic drink boxes are a relatively small and shrinking fraction 

of Aggregate Discards. Since 2005, the quantity of cartons being discarded declined by 
more than a third. Though in small quantities, cartons and aseptic boxes are the most 

commonly misplaced recyclable item with 8% of cartons being recycled with Paper instead

MGP Recycling Contamination
Contamination in MGP recycling decreased from 26.6% in 2013 to 19.5% in 2017. Some 

of this decrease is due to the expansion of the MGP recycling program to include all rigid 

plastics. In 2013, 9.4% of MGP recycling collections consisted of non-bottle rigid plastics, 

which were considered contamination at the time. In 2017, these items were targeted for 

recycling and no longer considered contamination.

Though the contamination rate was far lower in 2017 than in 2013, the overall amount 

of contamination remained the same due to the fact that more overall MGP was being 

recycled in 2017. While the average New Yorker properly recycled more MGP in 2017, 

they still improperly placed the same amount of non-recyclables into the MGP stream.

Organics
Organics suitable for composting—including food scraps, food-soiled paper, and yard 

waste—make up a large and still growing fraction of overall discards. In 2017, food scraps 

comprised the largest single category of waste in Aggregate Discards. Together, food 

scraps, food-soiled paper and yard waste make up more than 34% of Aggregate Discards, 

and diverting these products from landfills is a core focus of NYC’s Zero Waste initiatives.

The 2017 Study was conducted while NYC was rolling out an Organics collection  

program to divert these materials to beneficial use. At the time, the vast majority of organic 

materials targeted in this program were still being discarded in Refuse, totaling over 650 

pounds per household.

Curbside Organics Collection Program
In Fiscal Year 2013, DSNY introduced a pilot program to collect source separated food 

scraps, food-soiled paper and yard waste from households in northern Staten Island.  

Since then, the NYC Organics curbside collection program has expanded to neighborhoods 

in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. As of the end of 2017, more than  

3.3 million New Yorkers are served by curbside Organics collection.

The 2017 Study sampled and characterized collections from districts where curbside Organics 

had been rolled out to establish a baseline composition of source separated Organics.

Although DSNY has paired this roll out with extensive public education, there is still a steep 

learning curve for residents who have never been asked to separate and store food scraps 

for recycling. For this reason, the amount of Organics collected for recycling in comparison 

to Refuse, Paper, and MGP collections are small—a little over 13,000 tons in total for 

2017—and represent the early adopters of the program.

The majority of Organics collected for recycling consisted of yard waste at 60% followed by 
food scraps at 31%. As shown below, contamination rates in Organics collections were 
low, averaging about 7%. Contamination consisted primarily of misplaced recyclables, 
Organics not accepted in the program (such as diapers, textiles and construction wood), 

plastic bags and food wrappers, and a variety of other inorganic materials. Clear recycling 

bags are accepted as liners for the brown Organics bins used to set out Organics for 

collection. As with other recycling programs, contaminants are mechanically separated out 

before the material is composted.

Textiles
Textiles, including unwanted clothing, linens, and shoes/accessories, continue to be a 

measurable fraction of Aggregate Discards, despite the existence of an array of programs 

to encourage donation or recycling of such items.

Between 2013 and 2017, the amount of clothing, shoes and accessories discarded 

per household has remained flat. The amount of non-clothing textiles—including linens, 

towels, stuffed animals and other cloth housewares but not carpets, rugs or upholstered 

furniture—has increased slightly, continuing a trend seen between 2005 and 2013.

The average 
household discarded 
120 pounds of 
textiles in 2017.

Harmful Household Products
Overall, Harmful Household Products are a very small,  

but growing fraction of discards, having almost doubled 

from 0.25% in 2005 to 0.43% in 2017. Despite being less 

than 1% of the waste stream, harmful household products 

have disproportionate impacts on the environment and 

human health when not properly managed. Most of the 

increase comes from home medical products, although 

nearly all categories have increased on a per household 

basis over time.

Electronic Waste
Electronic waste, or “e-waste”—including televisions, computers, tablets, printers, and 

other TV and computer peripherals—is another small but important fraction of discards, 

one that has been targeted by legislation, and that has seen a large evolution in product 

design over the last decade. E-waste is a category of durable products that are not thrown 

out frequently, but can contain heavy metals and other harmful products that can be 

detrimental to the environment if not properly handled. 

Starting in 2015, disposal of e-waste in curbside Refuse collections was prohibited by State 

law, subject to a $100 fine in NYC. New Yorkers subsequently began to take advantage of 

the various e-waste recycling options offered by DSNY and other non-profit organizations 

and private companies. At the same time, innovations have lead to widespread retirement 

of old, heavier electronics in favor of new, lightweight equipment. For example, heavy 

cathode ray televisions, the primary type of TV for several decades, have been extensively 

replaced by lighter weight flat screen TVs over the past ten years.

The 2017 Study documents the effects of the e-waste disposal ban and product 

design changes. In four years, e-waste has declined by almost two thirds from 0.89% 

of Aggregate Discards in 2013 to 0.34% in 2017. On a per household per year basis, 

discarded televisions alone declined from an average of 5.1 pounds per household in  

2013 to 0.4 pounds per household in 2017. 

In four years, 
e-waste has

Discards in 2013 to

Film plastics are not designated for recycling by DSNY due to technical challenges and 

limited or non-existent recycling markets for these commodities. That being said, they 

make up substantial portions of contamination in Paper and MGP collections. Garbage 

and recycling bags (2.5%) are an expected part of discards as they are used as a tool to 

set out discards for collection. In fact, the sheer volume of Refuse and recycling that needs 

to be picked up every day coupled with the density of the built environment in NYC has 

made bagged curbside collections the most efficient strategy. Additionally, smaller plastic 

shopping bags (1.9%) are commonly used as a “carrier” to throw away discards  

in apartment living.

On a per household basis, there has been a steady decline in the amount of shopping bags 

discarded, with around 36 pounds per household in 2017, down from 60 lbs per household 

in 2005. This may be due in part to the redesign of bags to weigh less. Another contributing 

factor may be the New York State plastic bag recycling law that requires retailers of a certain 

size to place recycling containers at the front of their stores for customers to voluntarily 

recycle their plastic film. We do not have statistics to document how much film is recycled  

in NYC through the State program, though anecdotal evidence suggests it is limited.

Construction and Demolition Debris
Construction and demolition (C&D) debris that are generated by contractors or fee-for-

service workers is considered commercial waste; it is the responsibility of the contractor 

to arrange for appropriate private disposal. When generated from do-it-yourself projects, 

however, it is legal to dispose of this type of material in DSNY Refuse collections.

The percentage of C&D in overall waste declined from 5.1% in 2013 to 4.5% in 2017.  

On a per household basis, this material declined from a high in 2005 of around 117 lbs  

per household per year to close to 88 lbs per household per year in 2017.

Most of the decline in C&D is due to declines in non-wood C&D materials like drywall, 

bricks, concrete, and other building materials set out for DSNY. Wood treated with 

preservatives has increased back to 2005 levels, while untreated wood declined.

C&D material in DSNY collections is considered part of the “Other” category of wastes 
for which there are no existing programs offered by DSNY, because while there are 

opportunities to recycle commercial construction and demolition debris in the private  

sector in dedicated collections, DSNY collects C&D material in Refuse trucks.

Conclusion

Throughout this section, we have described a range of factors that contribute to NYC’s 

residential waste composition. Waste composition is important to assessing how well  

the City is diverting materials from landfills and how much more we can potentially achieve. 

The baseline composition of Aggregate Discards is a reflection of the types of products 

produced by industry, consumed by residents, and discarded. What citizens consume and 

discard places a limit on what can be achieved even with perfect recycling. For New York 

City in 2017 residential curbside collections, this limit is 34% for Paper and MGP recycling 

with another 34% for Organics recycling. 

Capture rates reflect the average recycling behaviors of citizens, including those who 

recycle 100% of what they could, those who fail to recycle at all, and everyone in between. 

The extent to which recycling collections are contaminated with non-recyclables, and the 

definition of what constitutes a non-recyclable in the first place, add complicating factors to 

interpreting recycling achievement. In addition, the extent to which individuals or organized 

groups scavenge recyclables from what residents set out at the curb before DSNY collects 

the material reduces our ability to measure recycling achievement, because this extraneous 

activity removes material before it can be measured. 

Trends in the composition of consumer products continue to evolve. Design choices by 

brand owners and manufacturers of products have both positive and negative effects on 

sustainable waste management, including their recyclability and toxicity, that municipalities 

have to respond to through planning, education and outreach, and legislation.

School Collections

There are over 1,800 public schools in New York City that 
receive DSNY collection. For the first time since 1990, the 
2017 Study included a baseline characterization of waste 
generated by NYC schools. See the method section for how 
the school waste characterization was conducted. The full 
school statistics for all sort categories (including the main 
material sort categories and the detailed sub-sort categories) 
can be viewed in the data files provided as a supplement to 
this report, available at nyc.gov/wastestudy.

In the decades since recycling was mandated in NYC,  
DSNY has worked with the Department of Education (DOE)  
to improve recycling compliance. Beginning in 2015, the 
Department of Sanitation partnered with DOE, and GrowNYC’s  
Recycling Champions Program to launch Zero Waste Schools  
(nyc.gov/zerowasteschools). The goal of this program is to 
divert all recyclable and compostable waste from approximately 
100 Zero Waste Schools in five years and to apply the best 
practices learned from these schools citywide. 

NYC School Waste Profile in 2017 

The 2017 Study shows that nearly 35% of the waste collected from schools consists 

of Paper and MGP recyclables, and more than half of everything generated consists of 

Organics suitable for composting. 13.9% of school waste consists of “Other” materials 

that require special handling (e-waste and harmful products), have alternative donation or 

recycling programs available (textiles), or have no readily available alternative to disposal.

Schools have the 
potential to divert 
as much as 86% 
of their waste 
for recycling or 
composting through 
DSNY curbside 
collections.

As shown below, the majority of Paper generated at schools in 2017 was clean corrugated 

cardboard with relatively smaller quantities of high-grade paper and mixed-grade paper. 

School waste contains measurable quantities of metal, rigid plastics, and beverage cartons 

but relatively little glass. Organics discarded by schools consists primarily of food scraps, 

followed by food-soiled paper, the majority of which is compostable trays used each day in 

school lunches. Very little yard waste is generated at schools and set out for DSNY collections.

Recycling Achievement

The charts below show the average recycling achievement of NYC schools in 2017. Some 

schools capture significantly more recyclables and have lower contamination of unwanted 

materials in recycling collections than others, but the 2017 Study documented that, on 

average, there is considerable potential to recycle more from school waste.

About 17% of Paper recycling collections consisted of contaminants. Some of those 

contaminants were MGP recyclables incorrectly placed in Paper recycling. A third of the 

contaminants were food-soiled paper including compostable plates from the cafeteria, 

which, while made from Paper, largely are covered by food residue. The results would 

appear to show that soiled and non-recyclable paper are an area of recycling confusion 

within school waste management. Clear plastic garbage bags used to set out Paper for 

collection made up 2.3% of the Paper stream.

Metal
Metal items made up 4.5% of school waste and were most successfully recycled with a 

capture rate of 20%. This largely came from ferrous (steel and tin) cans with about a third 

of these cans captured in the MGP recycling collections. Ferrous cans tend to come from 

school kitchens and are commonly recognized as a recyclable by kitchen staff. Almost  

all aluminum cans, foil or containers were discarded in the Refuse, and about a fifth of  

other metal items, consisting largely of bulky metal, durable items, and aerosol cans,  

were captured in MGP recycling.

Rigid Plastics
Recyclable plastic made up 6% of school waste. Most of this material came from food 

service including bottles and jugs, non-bottle rigid containers, and single use plates, cups 

and cutlery. The vast majority of these items were found in Refuse and not MGP recycling. 

Close to 13% of other rigid plastics, including durables and bulky items, were recycled.

Cartons
11.8% of Beverage cartons (primarily milk cartons) were captured in MGP recycling with 

the rest being found in Refuse.

Glass
There is very little glass in school waste, 5.4% of which was captured in MGP recycling.

MGP Recycling Contamination
More than 40% of MGP recycling collections consisted of contaminants. Some of those 

contaminants were Paper recyclables incorrectly placed in MGP recycling. More than half 

of the contamination was food and food-soiled paper. Most MGP recyclables consisted 

of food service packaging and food was likely placed in MGP recycling through improper 

sorting in the cafeterias or other feeding locations. Clear plastic garbage bags used to set 

out MGP for collection made up 6.5% of the MGP stream.

Conclusion

The 2017 composition of school waste confirms anecdotal observations that over half  

of all school waste going to disposal is compostable Organics, suggesting a strong future 

for separate school Organics collection in the years to come as this service expands to all 

schools in NYC. In addition, while schools do achieve some recycling success, much more 

is possible.

VII. Results:  New York City
Housing Authority

DSNY collects waste from all New York City Housing Authority 
(NYCHA) properties, which range from small, standalone 
buildings to large, multi-building complexes and has a total 
of more than 177,000 housing units. For the first time, the 
2017 Study included a baseline characterization of Refuse 
generated by NYCHA housing developments. See the method 
section for how the NYCHA waste characterization was 
conducted. The full NYCHA statistics for all sort categories 
(including the main material sort categories and the detailed 
sub-sort categories) can be viewed in the data files provided 
as a supplement to this report, available at nyc.gov/wastestudy.

While DSNY does collect paper and MGP recycling from NYCHA properties, these are 
generally collected as part of regular curbside recycling collections, and the overall quantity 

of recyclables collected at NYCHA is relatively small. The vast majority of NYCHA waste 

is Refuse collected through dedicated containerized collections. This Study examines the 

composition of those containerized Refuse collections.

46  |  2017 NYC Residential, School, and NYCHA Waste Characterization Study

For much of the last three decades, the residents of most NYCHA 
developments have lacked access to convenient and consistent 
recycling programs. In 2015, NYCHA committed to offering access 
to recycling services to all NYCHA residents through its program, 
NYCHA Recycles! DSNY continues to partner with NYCHA to offer 
staff and resident trainings and outreach to grow participation. 
Find out more at on.nyc.gov/dsny-nycha-recycles.  

NYCHA Waste Profile in 2017

About 33% of NYCHA waste is recyclable in DSNY’s curbside collections and another 32% is 

Organics suitable for composting. The primary difference between the NYCHA waste and non-

NYCHA residential waste is the relative share of yard waste, here only 2.4% of total waste.

Results by Material Category

From July 2016 to June 2017, DSNY collected over 142,000 tons of Refuse from  

NYCHA containers on dedicated routes. While a small percentage of DSNY’s overall waste 

collections, understanding how much of each material is generated by NYCHA residents can 

help to determine the latent opportunity to recover valuable materials from this waste stream.
